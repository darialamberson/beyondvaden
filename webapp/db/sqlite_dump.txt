I approach therapy with an active style, providing direct feedback in a supportive manner. For more than twenty years, I have been successfully helping individuals and couples find greater enjoyment in life. For therapy to work, I believe that the therapist needs to care about, and feel connected to, the individuals he or she works with. Psychotherapy is not just a job; helping people get better and live their life in a fuller happier way is something I strive for. My areas of specialization include: depression and anxiety, stress management, marital and couples therapy, eating disorders: compulsive or bulimia, parenting issues, adolescents, alcoholism, and adult children of alcoholics. I also work well with individuals coping with infertility, and adults were sexually or physically abused in childhood, and interpersonal group therapy. My style is to be active and responsive during the session. Unlike the media''s standard portrayal of therapists, I don''t believe in answering a question with a question. I provide interpretations of the client''s inner experiences and behavior as appropriate.

Eating disorders create significant challenges for teens and their families in all aspects of their lives. Sometimes these challenges require intensive treatment. Through our multidisciplinary approach, we address physical, emotional, and nutritional health, academic functioning, and family and peer relationships. Our goal is to provide holistic care that supports adolescents and their families in finding new and healthy ways of living. So often, teens with eating disorders and their families feel isolated and alone. Our program provides structure and support. It gives clients a chance to connect, relate and problem solve with others that struggle with similar issues. We help guide families in supporting their loved ones in a safe and caring way.  <h3>Why adolescent only treatment?</h3> The Healthy Teen Project believes a teenager-only therapeutic environment is important when treating teens with eating disorders as teens have specific needs that are different than those of adults: Family support - with teens, family support and therapy is an integral component, both for nutritional rehabilitation and to explore other challenges of adolescence and mental health. Group therapy and support from their peers - group therapy allows teenagers to find a place where they can open up and be honest and real about their struggles, relate to others, and receive much needed support. Teenagers are at very different places in life than adults and it is other teenagers that provide the validation and support they require. Greater focus on behavioral and experiential opportunities vs. cognitive/verbal skills Teenagers get more out of "doing" rather than "talking about doing". At HTP, teenagers are actively engaged in experiential opportunities and behavioral approaches, such as art therapy, yoga therapy, meal preparation and restaurant exposures. Additionally, HTP provides a teen-oriented environment where teens can feel safe, nurtured and hopeful. By not treating adolescents along side adult peers, HTP is able to provide the interventions specific to teens with eating disorders.  <h3>The Healthy Teen Project Team</h3> Our multidisciplinary team consists of professionals with medical, psychiatric, therapy and nutritional backgrounds.
