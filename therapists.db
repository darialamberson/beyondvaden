1	143458	April R Holman PHD A Professional Psychology Corp	I view psychotherapy as a collaborative process helping clients enhance their coping and adaptation. I have extensive experience using a diverse array of evidence-based treatment interventions. One size doesn't fit all! Treatment goals are established by the client and I, using those tools that best fit client's goals, whether more limited in scope or far reaching. I worked with adults, kids 11 years and older, and couples. For kids peer pressure, academic problems, developmental transitions,, parenting issues among other problems are addressed . Please view my website for an in-depth view of how I work with clients. Time limited therapy, such as stress management, or extensive emotional, interpersonal or career change is provided, given my expertise in the use of cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, relaxation and mindfulness, psychodynamic psychotherapy. I help client maximize coping and adaptation at different stages of life and coping with health/dental problems. It's unusual to find a clinician treating the psychosocial aspects of health or dental problems outside of a medical setting. I provide a personalized experience while effectively collaborating with the client's treatment team. This gives the client the 'best of both worlds:'integrated care and a personalized experience.	6504253746	2016-05-05 00:57:03	2016-05-05 00:57:03

3	92627	Nina Poletika	I know that sometimes there are confusing and difficult periods in anyone's life when a person may find that he or she needs support/help from someone other than their friends or family. At these times, it can be a strange process to seek such assistance from a virtual stranger. In an effort to help you with this process let me share my approach to my work... My experience as a therapist has made me trust that individuals, with the help of another, have the capacity to know themselves better than anyone else can. They can access their own answers/wisdom, and attend to their own wounds. My belief is that people can grow and heal no matter how intense their difficult experiences, defenses, and hurts may be. I see myself as a skilled partner in this internal journey of exploration and emotional resolution. Along with my general practice I specialize in... Depression, Alzheimer's support, and Grief. I understand and know depression and can sit with a person's deep pain as they heal. Supporting my own mother, who lives with dementia, I am committed to helping other families with this emotional journey.	6502765441	2016-05-05 00:57:16	2016-05-05 00:57:16
4	106653	Isobel Scher	My ideal clients are CHILDREN in distress and their PARENTS. I have many years of experience working with children's social/emotional, behavior and learning problems. Parents are often desperate for help saying: "My child is smart but not reaching his potential. I sometimes feel like a parent failure. I am beginning to feel helpless and hopeless. I don't know what to do about my child's difficult behavior. I can't bear to watch the struggle with homework and school. My child seems not to have any friends. As a parent I feel HELPLESS and need some guidance and reassurance." When children have problems, they lose sight of their abilities and strengths. My therapeutic task is to help everybody recognize and use these to address the problems. This result is raised self esteem and is the beginning of positive change. It leads to behavior change, friendship skills and greater academic success. I have many years of experience working with social / emotional effects of children's school and learning problems. I recognize and identify children's forgotten positive abilities and strengths. I truly believe that children hold the key to the solutions of their problems and I assist them in finding these.	6508622133	2016-05-05 00:57:20	2016-05-05 00:57:20
5	187335	Jana Emerson	I am a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and Registered Art Therapist, who works with adolescents, adults and families. I am dedicated to assisting individuals reach their true potential by using an empathetic, collaborative and solution driven format.

I also find that using art can enhance the process. Special interested include anxiety, compulsive behavior, depression, habits and addictions, and relationships. Modalities I often use are a variant of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (or CBT) and Solution Focused Therapy. In many cases, a person's mood is directly linked to their thought process and internal dialogue. Empirically based methods can help to change negative thought patterns that are keeping us stuck in a negative mindset.	6503183809	2016-05-05 00:57:26	2016-05-05 00:57:26

7	254914	Lilya Osipov	As a psychologist working with adults, adolescents, and families, I specialize in the treatment of eating disorders, body image concerns, anxiety disorders, alcohol use problems, life transitions, and related difficulties. My approach is integrative, individualized, and some may say irreverent. I aim to help my clients create a life worth living and use therapeutic approaches that are supported by research. Because no two people and no two families are the same, I tailor treatment to my clients needs and circumstances. To help clients track progress towards their treatment goals, I use assessment to inform and individualize treatment. How do you want to live your life? What is important to you? Sometimes thoughts, feelings, and behaviors get in the way of change. I work collaboratively with my clients to help them set goals that are consistent with their life priorities and overcome problems that get in the way. Areas of expertise include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). I also specialize in CBT for eating disorders across the life span as well as dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) and family based therapy (FBT) for eating disorders. In addition, I integrate mindfulness, compassion, and acceptance and commitment informed interventions into my practice.	4088998016	2016-05-05 00:57:35	2016-05-05 00:57:35
8	251620	Jenny Abouav	I can appreciate that different stages of life bring different challenges, and see my role as both a witness and a guide for my client's process. I would describe my style as that of an empathic listener, who is supportive while also challenging my clients to help them reach their personal goals. By supporting my clients with EMDR therapy, I believe I can help them pursue the resolution and personal growth they are seeking. My goal is to help my clients move beyond just surviving, and into a space of thriving. Additionally, I have a strong background in developmental disorders and supporting families with developmentally delayed children.	6506562638	2016-05-05 00:57:38	2016-05-05 00:57:38
9	96680	Barbara Cohen	My training in a diverse set of approaches to counseling and therapy provides me with a suite of tools to use in our relationship in the best way to help you achieve your goals. I deal with you as a whole person, in the context of your history, relationships &amp; present life. I work with a wide population of individuals, couples and groups. I have a lifetime of experience and a suite of skills from which to draw in order to work with you in the most appropriate and effective manner helping you achieve your goals in life. RELATIONSHIPS... Life is all about relationships and how we deal with them. When we have negative life experiences from the past we bring the end results of those experiences into our current relationships. Hence, our work together is to identify and convert dysfunctional behaviors into more positive and appropriate behaviors. Having lived abroad in several countries and having lived in the Silicon Valley for over 30 years, I bring a multi-cultural perspective to all my encounters. I work with my clients in a healing partnership, customizing my approaches for their particular needs and abilities.	6504926743	2016-05-05 00:57:46	2016-05-05 00:57:46
10	60795	Ilene Diamond	Struggling with anxiety, depression, substance use or other self-defeating behaviors? Challenged by work, relationship or family issues? Concerned about your own or your teen's mood, judgment, behavior? Executive stress? General overwhelm? Therapy provides a safe space for processing thoughts and feelings, and for exploring different ways of being. Whatever your concerns, we'll work together to help you feel better. My style is warm and collaborative, with a sense of humor. Our work can develop your strengths &amp; self-confidence &amp; help you feel more comfortable in your own skin, leading to a greater sense of vitality and peace of mind. I enjoy working with teens/tweens, gifted adolescents, couples, students, recent grads, entrepreneurs, tech workers and with men interested in developing their emotional intelligence and improving their relationships. Physicians and attorneys have high rates of psychological distress. Therapy can make your work in these demanding professions more sustainable and rewarding. Before becoming a psychologist, I worked as a lawyer. I've also worked as an educator, and I am an experienced mediator. Some clients find my familiarity with career transitions and the worlds of business, law, and education enhances our work. LGBT friendly. Substance abuse expertise. Executives; entrepreneurs. Conflict resolution.	4158201508	2016-05-05 00:57:50	2016-05-05 00:57:50
11	83885	Christopher Sato-Perry	For over 21 years, I've collaborated with people to resolve their psychological trauma, phobias, anxiety &amp; stress as well as maximize responses to their medical diagnoses, treatments &amp; conditions. This clinical focus stems from both a personal medical challenge since age 12 and research on treating women with breast cancer and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Yet Kaiser research (1998) finding 70% of primary care visits are driven by mental, emotional and relational issues highlights how mind and body are interwoven for each of us. This interplay provides leverage for preventive medicine, for responding to illness and for maximizing peak performance. Along with Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, I integrate: * EMDR: Unlocks the inner prison of limiting beliefs, whether for stress, anxiety, phobias, trauma, PTSD or peak performance. * Interactive Imagery: Self-hypnosis. * Biofeedback: Psycho-physiological self-regulation. * Capnometry: Prevents hyperventilation (the grease on the "slippery slope" of distress). * Interactive Metronome: Hones attention via training "time intelligence" within milliseconds. I have trained with Georgetown's Mind-Body Medicine &amp; CancerGuides programs. Yet working &amp; traveling abroad four years is my best education. Techniques are tools, and two years' translating Gorbachev at a Soviet news agency woke me to safely dialoguing with creative &amp; destructive forces internationally. Doing this innerpersonally &amp; interpersonally rewards us at least as much.	6504407197	2016-05-05 00:57:54	2016-05-05 00:57:54
12	40912	Vinh Thai	Perhaps a significant relationship is not working well. Perhaps you are having difficulty finding a mate. Perhaps you are having difficulty achieving the goals of your career. You may feel depressed, fearful, or angry. You may feel disengaged, distracted, or unmotivated. You have tried the self-help books. You might have sought advice from other psychotherapists. Yet, you have not been able to take their good advice and follow through. Even if there was improvement, it was not lasting. Is there some force within that is blocking you and preventing you from fully developing and enjoying the gift of your life? Emotions are ephemeral. The associated beliefs, mostly unconscious. One cannot understand and change experiences that are not alive and present. Therefore, I attend closely to what is occurring in the moment. Only then can we bring them from unconsciousness and hope to find a better way. I hope that, having met me, you will decide that I could tolerate and understand your feelings, whether good or bad, so that there is a chance for you to learn and to develop something new within yourself more to your liking.	6502000390	2016-05-05 00:58:00	2016-05-05 00:58:00
13	253995	Karlie Thompson	Life can sometimes becomes overwhelming for teens and their families. Young people can struggle with a variety of social, emotional, and cognitive difficulties that cause a great deal of pain for the entire family. My goal is to connect with struggling teens by offering support and teaching coping strategies to manage their stress and help them create a life worth living. An important part of this process includes offering support to parents who are feeling lost and shut out. I teach teens and parents to effectively communicate by learning to negotiate and balance the wants/needs of all family members. I am trained in evidenced-based treatment approaches, including Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). I specialize in the treatment of Mood Disorders (Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar Disorder), Autism Spectrum Disorders (PDD-NOS, Asperger's, High Functioning Autism), ADHD, and oppositional and behavioral issues with adolescents. I also offer Equine Therapy to individuals and families, and I currently have a waiting list for my Teen Emotional Support Group that focuses on providing teens the opportunity to receive support form their peers and teaches emotional management and life skills.	4154232543	2016-05-05 00:58:06	2016-05-05 00:58:06
14	93500	Mary Bibb	We will work together to empower you to overcome depression, anxiety, unwanted habits (procrastination, overeating, smoking, etc.), grief, cancer stress, or to improve difficult relationships at home or at work. As an experienced Board Certified Psychiatrist, I provide confidential, respectful, caring therapy for adults, using evidence-based treatments including Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), Brief Psychodynamic therapy, or Hypnosis (for smoking and weight loss). My experience of caring for hundreds of patients over the years has shown me that each of you brings something special and wonderful, even when you feel frightened, "worthless," "inadequate," powerless or angry. Cognitive therapy helps us see how negative thoughts can cause uncomfortable feelings. Psychodynamic therapy helps us understand how those thoughts developed. Throughout the years, I have taught psychiatry skills to psychiatry residents and continue to update my skills regularly. I am currently studying and leading groups in Cognitive Therapy/TEAM at Stanford University in one of the classes taught by David Burns, MD	6503186445	2016-05-05 00:58:09	2016-05-05 00:58:09
15	192487	Barbara Green	I work best with individuals and couples who are interested in understanding how they got stuck and who want to develop skills and insights to move forward. Everyone gets stuck in their life or relationships at times. Perhaps there is job stress, a new baby, a divorce or break up, sexual/intimacy problems or a last child leaving home. Sometimes we know we are distressed but don't really know why. I strive to create a safe and accepting atmosphere in my office that enables people to be less reactive and more thoughtful and creative in addressing their conflicts. I have trained extensively with Dr. Harville Hendrix (Getting the Love You Want), Dr. Pat Love (Hot Monogamy and The Emotional Incest Syndrome) and Dr. Ellyn Bader (In Quest of the Mythical Mate and Tell Me No Lies). Since 2008 I have been training in empirically validated Emotionally Focused Therapy. Please call or email for a free phone consultation.	3128185548	2016-05-05 00:58:12	2016-05-05 00:58:12
16	102747	Julie Gerhardt	Life presents us with many joys and sorrows, risks and opportunities. Our histories and fears mold our choices and can prevent us from achieving our life goals. My clients consist of professional adults and couples who seek psychotherapy, professional counseling and/or coaching. I work with people with a variety of emotional difficulties: isolation, depression, anxiety, PTSD, trauma and crisis. Often they have lost, or fear the loss of, a meaningful relationship, or feel despair about ever finding a loving partner. Other clients feel frustrated with their careers or harbor hidden resentments due to the success of others. I also work with people who feel unable to pursue their creative - professional projects or refrain from self-destructive behaviors. Some people need a more positive coaching approach to develop tools to help them move forward. Therapy involves, in part, a journey into the life of buried feelings and beliefs about self and others. I offer an empathic, integrative approach grounded in the attempt to clarify and work through internal issues keeping a person stuck while also focusing on roadblocks in the present. My hope is that by the end of therapy, clients will feel more satisfied with their lives and will be able to problem-solve future difficulties.	6502624719	2016-05-05 00:58:20	2016-05-05 00:58:20

I work with adults over 18 and do not accept insurance. Living and working in one of the most expensive and well-educated places in the country brings significant stressors. Having a happy, stable, successful, and enjoyable life is not easy. I help people develop goals and make the changes needed to bring together these essential elements to yield a life well-lived.	6505626096	2016-05-05 00:58:23	2016-05-05 00:58:23
18	166652	David Sitzer	I received my Ph.D. from Alliant University. I have been in private practice as a psychologist since 1993, specializing in helping children, adolescents and adults develop better communication, conflict resolution and family cohesion. I also have extensive work experience with individuals struggling with Autistic spectrum issues and addictions. I provide clinical case consultation to licensed practitioners and clinical supervision to pre-licensed interns. I also offer academic tutoring to students in psychology. I see psychotherapy as a place where trusting relationships develop that promote confidence in life. I help clients thrive in ways that are meaningful to them through a combination of cognitive, emotional, and motivational psychology approaches. I strive to help clients clarify their experiences, since confusion often accompanies psychological problems. I have found that once problems are understandable, anxiety and depression become more manageable. Clients can then identify and correct areas of change. Working in a positive psychological frame is a refreshing approach most people are unaccustomed to experiencing in psychotherapy.	6507204747	2016-05-05 00:58:27	2016-05-05 00:58:27

By using a variety of methods such as neurofeedback, peripheral biofeedback, and brain training methods for learning such as Cogmed Working Memory Training and PACE cognitive enhancement, I am able to help both students and professionals strengthen their cognitive abilities and reach their goals. Neurofeedback is a way to train the brain to higher levels of functioning using EEG technology and fun interactive games. I practice several forms of neurofeedback, including Z-Score training, 19 channel LORETA feedback, and LENS neurofeedback.	6502764246	2016-05-05 00:58:33	2016-05-05 00:58:33

24	55229	Sally Hayman	It is my firm belief that people do their best with the situations life hands them. My goal as a therapist is to help people work through their stuck places, let go of old behaviors that helped them survive in the past but are no longer useful, and learn new behaviors that will contribute to greater enjoyment and connection in their lives.

29	32244	Virginia Humphrey	My practice philosophy is that all of my patients deserve the best care possible, and I strive to provide that quality of care. I respect each person's individuality, his/her strengths and life accomplishments which must not be obscured by the often presenting pain, distress and possible disability. Jungian psychotherapy and psychoanalysis bring hope for a greater sense of wholeness and well-being; each of us has the innate ability to grow and change inside ourselves as well as in relationships. Life then becomes richer, holding deeper meaning for each of us. Exploring the inner world of feelings, thoughts and images help us in our work to improve relationships and the quality of life experienced.	6506030378	2016-05-05 00:59:27	2016-05-05 00:59:27

Your therapist will guide and support you on that path. My patients have improved their lives, their relationships and their professional success and satisfaction. The therapist's training and experience are equally important. I have nearly 40 years of experience and have treated hundreds of patients. I also teach and supervise other therapists. I'm bi-lingual and treat patients in English and Hebrew. I also employ and supervise two highly talented interns, which allows us to provide high quality therapy at a much reduced cost. Call me and let's talk. Maybe I'm therapist for you. Thanks, Miriam Bar	6506810867	2016-05-05 00:59:38	2016-05-05 00:59:38

34	41078	Eval Gal-Oz	My practice provides caring and sensitive treatment for mental, emotional and behavioral problems. My approach draws upon many years of extensive experience. It builds upon each patient's strengths, while improving interpersonal and emotional skills. My therapy is personalized, recognizing that each patient is a unique individual with his or her own very personal history and issues. My goal is to use psychotherapy to guide patients in achieving an awareness and understanding the sources of their psychological problems, and then work through those problems so they can feel better about themselves and lead healthier and happier lives. I use psychodynamic/psychoanalytic method of treatment that achieves a better self-understanding of one's mental life, and leads to psychological health. This method considers both conscious and unconscious levels, and recognizes that childhood events have a powerful influence throughout life. I have extensive experience in helping patients deal with a wide range of psychological and interpersonal problems, with a special focus on depression, anxiety, relationship and intimacy issues, bereavement/grief counseling. I also specialize in eating disorders and weight loss, aided by research work done at Stanford University.	6506030864	2016-05-05 00:59:53	2016-05-05 00:59:53
35	102889	Diana Barrett	I am trained in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of learning, autism spectrum, mood, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders, across the lifespan. I have worked with children as young as 3 years old and adults as young as 72! People often seek my services secondary to unanswered questions regarding their struggles at school, at home, at work, or socially. Sometimes my clients have had previous evaluations which have failed to address pressing concerns. I pride myself in continuing to work with individuals until the root of their struggles (beyond diagnosis) is uncovered and the appropriate recommendations can be made. I completed my graduate work at the University of Montana, internship at University of Utah Neuropsychiatric Institute and postdoctorate training at Stanford University School of Medicine. I work closely with a team of neuropsychologists and Stanford University psychiatrists to ensure comprehensive and top level care for my clients. I offer evidence based interventions for Executive Functioning and ADHD. The clinic with which I work is the Bay Area's largest provider of Cogmed (an evidence home based program for working memory and attention). I have specialty training in Motivational Interviewing and Dialectical Behavior Therapy. I am fluent in Italian.	6502273219	2016-05-05 00:59:59	2016-05-05 00:59:59
36	151005	Inge Hansen	I am here to help you become your best and most fulfilled self, even if you don't know what that self might be like yet. I will sit down with you and explore what is getting in the way in your life, whether it's depression, anxiety, relationship issues, pain from your past, or another concern entirely. Once we have a sense of what is hard for you, then we can work together to get you to a better place. We will find a way, or we will make one. My therapeutic style is warm and open, and also quite honest and direct. My goal is to create an environment where you feel safe being your most authentic, vulnerable self, but where you also know that you will receive honest feedback about yourself and your impact on others. I head up a program at Stanford specializing in promoting mental health and wellness across all genders and sexual orientations, so I am likely to be an especially good match for you if you are exploring your gender or sexuality. I have over 10 years' experience as a generalist as well.	6505572274	2016-05-05 01:00:05	2016-05-05 01:00:05
37	46275	Susan Owicki	I work with individual adults, couples, and families in a collaborative and respectful style. My intent is to help you discover what you want to be different in your life and then find ways to make those changes. Often this means improving relationships -- learning about communication, finding better ways to deal with conflict, and becoming closer. At other times the goals are more individual, such as gaining self-confident, dealing with painful emotions, or learning to make wiser choices. To learn more about my background and counseling approach, see my website at www.OwickiMFT.com	6509184808	2016-05-05 01:00:08	2016-05-05 01:00:08

39	116837	Zoe Mount	I have been a licensed therapist since 2004. I work primarily with adolescents and their families, as well as with adults. I have a great deal of experience working with teens and their families around issues such as chore compliance, school refusal, and helping teens begin the process of picking and apllying for college. I work well with tweens (12-14) and teens (14-18) and am comfortable working with the family as a whole, to resolve issues such as curfew, chores and 'general attitude' or with just the teen to offer a place for the venting of feelings and sorting out the many challenges and changes facing teens. I have worked with teens since my internship, in 20000. I am vey comfortable with this unique population who present a special set of needs and sills.	6508307478	2016-05-05 01:00:16	2016-05-05 01:00:16
40	73038	Inna Matov	As a psychologist, I assist people in acquiring greater creative and emotional competencies, reconnecting with themselves and significant others, and removing obstacles to personal happiness and joy. Psychotherapy is about personal growth, healing after emotional trauma and grief, and realizing one's fullest potential. In therapy sessions we examine meaningful relationships, communication styles, and barriers to success with a goal of restoring a sense of balance to your life and, by extension, to the lives of others who care deeply about you. For those who wish to deepen their self-understanding, we explore the unconscious by analyzing dreams, memories, and fantasies. Potential benefits of therapy include, but are not limited to: relief from depressive and overly-anxious feelings, increase in one's creative capacities to solve life's problems, greater tolerance for ambiguity in our existence, and development of a deeper understanding of self and relationships with others. Additionally, I am fluent in Russian and I welcome Russian-speaking therapy clients.	6505166741	2016-05-05 01:00:22	2016-05-05 01:00:22
41	138102	Sarah Tachibana 	As my client, I believe that you have an innate potential for growth and transformation. When at an impasse, new perspectives and resources are needed to restore balance within oneself and in relation to others. As a warm, interactive psychotherapist, I provide the experience, guidance, and skill that foster insight, transformation and growth. You will be provided a safe place where you will be supported to find and use your strengths. Together, we will develop tools to work through obstacles. It's time to get unstuck and to live in the moment, where you can accomplish your goals and be your true self.	6505138208	2016-05-05 01:00:26	2016-05-05 01:00:26
42	95884	Christy Telch	Life's problems can feel much more difficult when faced alone. Perhaps you are struggling with a painful loss, are overwhelmed by fear, anger, loneliness or depression. You may be stuck in patterns of negative, self-critical thinking and inner pressure may cause you to feel tense and exhausted. You may feel shame and hopelessness and your means of coping such as avoidance, procrastination, withdrawal or overeating adds to your distress. I help people struggling with anxiety, panic, depression, phobias, eating issues, and relationship distress to understand these problems and develop skills to feel better and create happier lives. We will focus on the changes you desire. Generally therapy aims to alleviate suffering and improve quality of life. Therapy can help you feel better by improving self-understanding, changing problematic thinking and behavior patterns, developing skills to manage painful emotions, generate positive emotions and nurture qualities such as compassion. We will consider several different treatment approaches in our work together. I typically integrate methods from a variety of research-supported therapies including cognitive behavior therapy, dialectical behavior therapy and psychodynamic psychotherapy. Many people find the mindfulness meditation, emotion regulation and exposure therapy skills I teach to be particularly helpful.	6503231637	2016-05-05 01:00:30	2016-05-05 01:00:30
43	77802	Richard Abbey	I am a neuropsychologist specializing in assessment and interventions for learning differences, attention, executive functioning, autism spectrum, mood, and stress. If you are having trouble pinpointing what is causing the struggle, and would like to learn about solutions that work, I can help. The process begins with an accurate and comprehensive assessment in which I use the latest research and technology. Sometimes my clients have had previous evaluations which have failed to address pressing concerns. I continue to work with individuals until the underlying cause of their struggles are identified; sparing no expense on the latest technology, My evaluations are comprehensive. The process begins with discussing your concerns in detail. You will be greeted by a warm and friendly staff. My goal is to provide assessments that are both informative and FUN! Many children report wanting to return because they enjoy the activities and the individualized attention. I offer a profile of individual strengths and weaknesses from which I provide comprehensive recommendations. You will know what to do at home and at school and will learn about evidenced-based interventions to improve functioning, such as Cogmed, QEEG (Brain Mapping), neurofeedback, counseling, and executive functioning coaching.	6504097640	2016-05-05 01:00:39	2016-05-05 01:00:39
44	54016	Been There-Adoption Counseling	Do you find yourself parenting a child who is acting out? Are you feeling frustrated and don't know where to turn? As an Adoption Therapist and Adoptive Mom I realized that traditional parenting did not work. I was frustrated, exhausted, confused and felt judged by others. I truly understand what you are going through. Eventually through experience, classes and workshops I learned how to be more sucessful. Now I work with parents like you to pass on what I have learned. An abundance of research has been conducted recently on children who act out due to neglect and abuse prior to adoption. Researchers discovered that chemical changes in these childrens's brains keep their levels of stress high. This can lead to many negative behavioral issues, challenging us as parents. Relational therrapy has been found to be one of the most effective therapies for early childhood trauma. Your relationship with your child is your most powerful tool for change. I can teach you how to help heal your child through your relationship. Our children are out best teachers.	4086415578	2016-05-05 01:00:44	2016-05-05 01:00:44

145	70190	Susan Light	For over 25 years I have worked with children, teens, parents, individual adults and couples facing a wide variety of issues and concerns. As I listen carefully to my clients and their challenges and goals, I choose the therapeutic modalities that best suit each individual and their needs. Whether working with a child in play therapy or teens and adults, I focus on personal strengths as well as struggles. People have described me as active, engaged, perceptive and caring.

49	66121	Susan Willis	It's exciting to see that you're exploring ways to improve your current dilemma--and your life. Whether your problem is one that is longstanding and has resisted change, or is new and unfamiliar, therapy will provide a safe and caring environment to work it through. I'll help you identify the blocks to your optimal functioning, understand them, and then develop better-fitting, more fruitful ways to think and act. It's a respectful, warm-hearted process, always focused on your uniqueness and wholeness. For over 25 years, I've helped people experiencing deep depression, life-limiting anxiety, impasses in work or relationships, difficult life passages, complex illnesses, and unfulfilled goals. I'm skilled in both brief solutions-focused therapy and longer term depth work. A Jungian orientation underlies my work. Since my background combines biology with psychology, I am able to address more than just your mind. I've found that results are enhanced by simultaneously cultivating better health and fitness, and deepened spirit. Wholeness is the goal. I invite you to visit my website, and look forward to speaking with you.	6502097802	2016-05-05 01:01:11	2016-05-05 01:01:11
50	136957	Gloria Diaz	Hi! I am an expert therapist specialized on Brief Therapy and supervised by the main reference on this methodology. With more than 7 years of experience, I am currently counseling in East Palo Alto schools and teaching several Master program classes. We will discover and emphasize the resources you have, as they will help us find the change that you need in order to get over your problematic situation. Brief Therapy is about trying to be effective in solving the problem and also effective time wise, because I do not want more suffering for you. I'm looking for a change in your actions that will create other changes as snow ball. Respect, responsibility and ethic are very important. I am constantly attending familiar and school crisis within a systemic approach, working with couples, families and individuals (kids and adolescents too). I will be very happy to meet you and, as a team, put the pieces in place and get the change you need to solve the problem.	4156302221	2016-05-05 01:01:16	2016-05-05 01:01:16
51	192788	Phyllis Klein	A large part of my life's purpose is to help women, men, and couples cope with and heal from life's traumas. I believe in therapy as a way to heal, starting with a caring relationship. Accidents, health issues, disease, child abuse (sexual, physical, emotional, or neglect), family problems, grief and loss, etc. can be traumatic. Problems add up and cause complex layers of stress and challenge over time. People say that I am warm and caring, I listen carefully, am patient, sensitive, and don't give up. I pay special attention to making the space safe for you. I work with complex traumas as well as clear cut problems. Trauma therapy is deeply personal. I offer you respect, acceptance, and hope in knowing that there are many tools to cope with the emotions that arise in working out your trauma. I use techniques such as EMDR to deepen and shorten your therapy, Focusing Oriented Therapy for awareness and somatic healing, Writing Therapy, for finding your voice, Restorative Yoga, for grounding and connecting with your body. These techniques are optional depending on what you need and want.	4156302326	2016-05-05 01:01:19	2016-05-05 01:01:19

53	39847	Larry O	My style is collaborative, and by virtue of my humor authentic. I draw from several theories, but my understanding of people relies on listening and checking whether I'm getting them. I don't just sit mute or blank faced. I provide other possibilities of understanding themselves and their lives. If I offer suggestions or strategies, I check whether they're are helpful, or how they can be better for their circumstances. People have expressed I get them, and the nuances of their situation, and feel respected as equals working with me. Using Fromm's idea, "The right to express our thoughts means something only if we are able to have thoughts of our own." I encourage couples to develop differentiation through communication, balancing connection with individuality; to help deepen involvement in the relationship while maintaining a sense of self within it. Often desire to change is a reaction to dissatisfaction, with our selves, relationships, or current circumstances. Unfortunately, reaction causes us to overlook our existing qualities, for unrealistic expectations, not what's already there. This invalidates who we are, what we're actually trying to realize, potentially making change more bewildering.	4157020951	2016-05-05 01:01:33	2016-05-05 01:01:33
54	45980	Sarah Villarreal	I am a licensed psychologist with ten+ years of experience. I have two areas of specialty: 1)Children/Adolescents and 2)Women.

I specialize in helping individuals with Self-Esteem Issues, Asperger's Syndrome, Depression, Anxiety and ADD/ADHD. With women, I use this same warm, interactive and non-judgmental approach to help you identify interpersonal patterns, enhance your awareness/insight and get you "unstuck". I want you to feel content in your own skin. I also use life-coaching techniques to guide you toward actualizing your potential. I am the founder of three successful businesses and I am currently working on a self-help book for women.	4155470931	2016-05-05 01:01:37	2016-05-05 01:01:37
55	68312	Marina Bystritsky	I'm a licensed clinical psychologist working with people to help them achieve lasting changes and create more fulfilling live. I pride myself on providing empirically supported, ethical and compassionate care to my clients. My therapeutic approach is collaborative, active and present focused. I believe that each person is unique, has his/her own unique history and goals and work with each client to develop individualized treatment plan designed to address each person's unique symptoms and needs. I specialize in treatment of the obsessive-compulsive and OCD spectrum disorders, anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder and agoraphobia, health anxiety, phobias, stress related conditions and depression. I use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. In addition to maintaining a private practice, I supervise psychiatry residents at OCD clinic at Stanford University School of Medicine.	6502097869	2016-05-05 01:01:43	2016-05-05 01:01:43
56	238602	EMDR Empowerment 	As a dedicated professional you have invested lots into your work &amp; feel good about what you have accomplished. Maybe you couldn't find time or room for relationships but now you want love. Or maybe you are unhappy in your relationship/marriage &amp; want connection. Sometimes just thinking about repairing a relationship or online dating can be overwhelming, right? Then these doubts come to mind &amp; you think what if you can't find anyone better, you're not that attractive, you're not fit enough, who would want to date you, relationships are hard &amp; you mess them up, it's hopeless... Wait, there is another way to think about dating and relationships. How good would it feel to be in love? How happy would you be to be in relationship with your ideal partner? I love empowering people in having their ideal relationship and EMDR helps that happen. How, you ask? EMDR silences the doubt, builds confidence, heals the past hurt and allows you to feel good about love &amp; relationships. How amazing to be your best self in your ideal relationship. Would you like to get started and experience a breakthrough EMDR session, give me a call (855) 293-0748.	8552930748	2016-05-05 01:01:50	2016-05-05 01:01:50
57	227371	Ayelet Kattan	I am a Licensed Psychologist and ACF Faculty at Stanford University. I specialize in helping people with anxiety, interpersonal/relationship issues, low self-worth/depression, intense emotions, sleep and life transitions. I enjoy helping many of my clients attain more satisfying relationships, connect with their values and aspirations, and be more authentic with themselves and others. I have 10+ years of experience providing evidence-based therapy, and aim to provide you with high quality, compassionate, and individualized care. My approach is warm and collaborative, yet active and goal oriented. I utilize cutting-edge, scientifically-validated treatments, including CBT, Mindfulness and DBT, while leveraging your strengths and enhancing resilience. Most importantly, I custom tailor these interventions to meet your unique needs, coming up with a treatment plan that is highly effective and long-lasting. I completed my postdoctoral fellowship in clinical psychology at Stanford University School of Medicine where I specialized in evidence-based treatments for anxiety, depression and interpersonal problems. In addition to my private practice, I am passionate about teaching and supervising psychology fellows and therapists, and teach postdoctoral fellows and psychologists at Stanford University.	6509008455	2016-05-05 01:01:55	2016-05-05 01:01:55
58	213208	Kristy Phillips	Why is it always easier to beat ourselves up than to say loving and empathic things to ourselves? I believe that we are comprised of multiple "parts" and that sometimes our negative parts are so loud, we have trouble connecting to our self-compassion. It can feel easier to perpetuate personal stories of unworthiness than to locate our strength. In my practice, I know that regardless of their pasts, everyone deserves compassion and the support to rewrite painful stories. It is easy to forget that moments of happiness are not the same thing as having meaning and purpose in life. On this journey, we delve into the past and learn to be mindful and authentic in the present through talk, meditation, and art. I help clients determine what healthy relationships feel like and to change those that are destructive. I am curious about how your relationships work to define you. I have not found "the answer." I follow your lead and I don't think that my approach is the only way to look at your challenges. I like to create space for play and collaboration. Relationship issues, depression, anxiety, and trauma are my specialities.	6503945315	2016-05-05 01:02:03	2016-05-05 01:02:03
59	233999	Yosi Amram	I offer holistic integrative psychotherapy for adults and couples, helping bring integration and wholeness to all major dimensions of our humanness: mind, heart, body and soul. My style is warm and unconditionally accepting, open-minded and open-hearted. I am always honored to be of help supporting each person in her or his unique journey towards happiness and life satisfaction. I have been fortunate to receive the 'Best of Palo Alto' Psychotherapist award for 2014 and see clients in my Rockridge-Oakland and Palo Alto offices. My approach is both pragmatic, offering near term relief, and deeper change, growth and transformation. I believe that we are all born with a passionate aliveness that is uniquely beautiful, radiant, joyful, trusting and loving. Unfortunately, this passionate aliveness often gets wounded and covered-up. Our deeper work together is to recover your passionate aliveness, manifesting meaningful work and loving interpersonal relationships, while also, pragmatically, addressing your near-term challenges. My specialty is working with professionals and executives addressing work, meaning, personal and relationship problems. In addition to my long-standing psychotherapeutic work, I draw on a rich set of life experiences, including a previous career in technology, an executive leadership coaching practice, and a deep commitment to my own growth and spiritual development.	5104021287	2016-05-05 01:02:08	2016-05-05 01:02:08
60	117172	Patrick Whalen	My clients come from a wide range of personal experiences, challenges, orientations, economic means, and cultural backgrounds. The problems faced are extremely varied. No problem is too small or too large for us to work with productively. There may be no clear cut solutions and often life is messy, unpredictable, and not exactly what we had hoped for or intended for ourselves and others; that being said, a healthy and caring relationship combined with thoughtful boundaries and a refined view and tools for promoting healing, skillful thought and behavior, and strengthening social bonds goes a long way towards inner peace. I specialize in individual adult, late adolescent, and romantic relationship therapy. I enjoy diversity of all kinds in my work. I typically see individuals for one year or more; couples, four to six months. Once a week is usually the minimum commitment in the beginning, more frequently has advantages. I teach meditation to interested individuals and groups. In recent years, there has been a large spike of interest within the scientific community, investigating the psychological and physical health benefits of meditation. The evidence has been overwhelmingly favorable -- meditation is a powerful cultivation practice.	6507275248	2016-05-05 01:02:11	2016-05-05 01:02:11

62	83775	Clodagh O	Have you ever had the experience of really wanting to CHANGE only to find yourself slipping into old habits the very next day? This happens when we change our thoughts yet our emotional body or emotional brain is still attached to the old behavior. A combination of psychotherapy and hypnotherapy can be really helpful to bridge the gap between our thoughts and emotional needs. When our thoughts, and emotions are aligned , hypnotherapy can direct newer behaviors into our everyday experience. Witnessing clients attempt to navigate their fears, and rediscover their real wisdom is truly a joyful experience. I specialize in supporting individuals, couples and families obtaining freedom from stuck or "not good enough" belief patterns that interfere with relationships and careers. In my experience these belief patterns can show up as "unexpressed passions". In order to get a fuller perspective of a client's life balance, I also explore the client's relationship to nutrition, exercise, and health. Emotional Freedom Technique or Hypnotherapy can offer another way to slow down mental chatter, reframe old beliefs, and to open up to intuition and passion.	4155704105	2016-05-05 01:02:22	2016-05-05 01:02:22

84	221333	Edna Wallace	It's difficult to start a course of therapy. But if you're in emotional pain, it can feel like moods and issues are running your life rather than you doing so. This can leave you feeling lost, confused, and distressed. When you're under this dark cloud, it can be very helpful to talk to an experienced objective outsider in a safe, confidential, and professional yet intimate setting. My goal is to work together to recognize hindrances and unhelpful patterns and to accentuate personal strengths in order to regain a sense of agency and equanimity in your life. I work with a diverse population. In addition to private practice, I work at a hospital program treating patients suffering from depression or anxiety. Thus, I have a wholehearted understanding of how completely that can affect people's lives. My specialties include: alternative lifestyles, issues related to aging, life transitions, grief and loss, moods. I have almost 10 years experience in the mental health field. I have been trained in Positive Psychology, Object Relations, Group therapy constructs, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and Mindfulness (DBT) coping skills. These methods can help alleviate symptoms of depression or anxiety and address debilitating aspects of trauma.

86	163463	Meghan Howe	Hello! I am a licensed clinical social worker that specializes in children, adolescents, and adults with mood disorders, or those, due to genetics, who are at high risk for mood disorders. For the past 10 years, I have worked with Dr. Chang in the Pediatric Bipolar Disorders Program at Stanford creating and modifying therapeutic treatment modalities for children and families. For this reason, I am best suited for clients with bipolar disorder, depression, ADHD, anxiety disorders, and behavioral difficulties. I see the most success when I am permitted to work with the client and the family. I use a combination of the following models to help families with mood disorders: family focused therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness based CBT, dialectical behavior therapy, &amp; mindfulness based stress reduction. Evidence suggests that these models significantly reduce mood symptoms/ episodes, increase emotional stability and medication adherence, and decease suicidal thoughts. I have co-authored many articles about pediatric bipolar disorder, this provides a vast amount of knowledge and experience from which I work. I believe each client will bring an uniqueness that relies on my ability to fine tune therapeutic models so the client's needs always come first.	6504897742	2016-05-05 01:04:25	2016-05-05 01:04:25

I believe that every person's journey through life is unique, but not without struggle, and am committed to helping you feel safe, engaged, and above all, to be a dedicated partner in navigating your healing process. In conjunction with traditional verbal therapy, I bring the option of integrating a somatic approach in order to deepen the therapeutic experience. Through this process, we explore the function of the body in emotional healing, as informed by my 30 years of mind-body practice (yoga, dance, mindfulness, and qi gong). I am experienced in working with individuals, couples, parents, and children from a wide range of backgrounds and issues, including military service members, veterans, individuals with disabilities and their family members, and people of all sexual orientations.	6503895655	2016-05-05 01:04:28	2016-05-05 01:04:28
89	225481	Dahlia Woods	Do you feel down in the dumps? Are you struggling with anxiety, worry, or stress? Are anxiety attacks keeping you from being successful? Would you like to feel happy and more fulfilled? Anxiety and mood disorders are very treatable. I am a psychiatrist offering therapy and/or medication management. In my practice, I assist adults and adolescents who seek help in overcoming anxiety, stress, depression, and relationship problems. Often, people experience significant relief from symptoms and meaningful improvements in the quality of their lives in just a few months of working together. I have worked closely with Dr. David Burns in TEAM-CBT, a new framework for therapy. TEAM therapy builds upon traditional CBT by focusing not only on cognitive and behavioral methods to help alleviate suffering, but also incorporating an emphasis on the therapeutic alliance and motivational techniques. I am a Level 3 TEAM Certified Therapist at the Feeling Good Institute, meaning that I have completed many hours of both individual and group training in TEAM therapy and have passed an oral clinical skills verification exam.	6504885627	2016-05-05 01:04:42	2016-05-05 01:04:42
90	116011	Elke Jahn	Transitions? Stress? Anxiety? Depression? Are your moods dictating how you feel about yourself and your relationships with others? Manage symptoms, while learning lasting strategies to avoid cycles of stress, pressure, and anxiety. Do you need to break through repetitive, self destructive habits? Actualize your true potential and enhance strengths. Recognize poor self care habits/routines and initiate lasting change. Learn to prioritize life goals and needs. Finally experience accomplishment, success, true esteem, and drive. Sharing my own wisdom and clinical expertise with my clients is the greatest honor and one of my passions in life. I offer a free consultation for new clientele. I accept Medicare Part B insurance and provide bills suitable for reimbursement for clients with out-of-network insurance coverage. My office is located in downtown Menlo Park in a safe neighborhood with ample free parking. The office is wheelchair accessible.	6504508940	2016-05-05 01:04:45	2016-05-05 01:04:45
91	139405	Stefanie Lamoy	I work with individuals, couples and families to recognize and embrace their strengths when faced with some of life's overwhelming challenges. I work to support client's needs and to meet them where they are using empathy and building a safe, non-judgmental relationship. I do this by being warm, using humor and working to problem solve all while considering the client's comfort level and flexibility. Over the last 7 years I have specialized in adolescent and family struggles, focusing on the effect of transitions from youth to adulthood.	6504886971	2016-05-05 01:04:49	2016-05-05 01:04:49
92	37716	Julie Gauthier	I believe that we grow through our struggles. They often point to parts of ourselves that are denied or have been banished to adapt to our early environments. In learning how to relate to and integrate more of our wholeness, we experience a greater capacity for and flexibility in relationships as well as a greater resiliency in their lives. I work with clients to increase awareness of themselves and their patterns, both healthy and unhealthy, to have greater choice and freedom in the way they live, and to discover lifepaths that authentically express who they are. I work with adults and couples and have an orientation that is holistic, depth-oriented, and transpersonal. My approach is eclectic and informed by several theoretical frameworks including: the neurobiological aspects of attachment (how we are hardwired to relate to ourselves and other) and trauma, relational, depth-oriented, transpersonal approaches. I provide a supportive environment to help adults and couples face issues of personal, psychological, and spiritual growth as well as find practical ways to improve their lives and relationships. I work to help clients develop a fuller, freer relationship with themselves that enhances their ability to relate to others.	6503858951	2016-05-05 01:04:56	2016-05-05 01:04:56
93	101338	Kristin Stent	My background and training is focused in the area of treating adolescents and adults who struggle with a wide range of adjustment issues and mental health diangoses. I work collaboratively with each client to develop a personal treatment plan that is responsive and effective. Through the interpersonal process, I also strive to create a trusting relationship with each client, where insight and growth can be fostered. My specialty areas include treating mild, moderate, and severe depression. I also work with clients with anxiety disorders such PTSD and OCD. I welcome clients with BiPolar Disorder and clients facing addiction issues.

94	169854	Anna Tran	Finding the right therapist for you is an important step in achieving change. As a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner Therapist, and having over 15 years experience working in psychiatry have taught me that every human being has the innate ability, through their own personality, values, and temperament to transform the roots of his/her suffering into a path of growth, and to experience happiness and joy. My core approach working with you is to guide you through achieving change with compassion, understanding and trust. I believe positive change can occur through a strong collaborative therapeutic process with your therapist. I offer an integrated traditional and intensive psychotherapy using cutting edge modalities of CBT-plus-T.E.A.M. Therapy, Mindfulness-Based Therapy, DBT, and Holistic values (exercise, meditation, nutrition). I have worked in many clinical settings in the greater Bay Area.

95	150136	Bette Kiernan	I work with a wide range of clients. Those confronting transitions, relationships problems, career concerns, addictions, student concerns and other challenges. Depression, anxiety, stress or addictive behaviors are usually the first step in a journey to self-discovery. I create a nurturing, supportive and warm space for my clients to examine their relationships, the impacts of their family environments, thought patterns and dreams. I help my clients understand concessions they may have been made in their original family enabled adaptation, but may later interfere with their fulfillment. Together we create new stories with happier endings. I have been in practice in Palo Alto, California for thirty years. I see individuals, couples, families and groups. My approach integrates Jungian, Cognitive, Psychodynamic, Buddhist and other theoretical perspectives. I create a new therapy for each client in order to evoke his or her underlying special and unique personality. I welcome the opportunity to work with dreams, fairy tales and the inner world. I believe creativity is the highest form of defense against psychological pain, and encourage my client's self expression. I frequently provide crisis interventions, trainings, and management consultations within many Silicon Valley Corporations.	6502410395	2016-05-05 01:05:11	2016-05-05 01:05:11
96	42206	Monique Jost-Vazire	Do you sometimes ask yourself: I feel angry, disappointed, or frustrated. What can I do? I tried everything, nothing works in the long term. Why are my relationships so unfulfilling? During sessions, you are gently guided to recognize the parts of your Self that have conflicting, often incompatible goals, perspectives, and beliefs. Those "parts" often pull you in opposite directions - "I want to eat, but I also want to lose weight" for example. Then you criticize yourself for not being more responsible, productive, etc... relationships, divorce or breakup, self-doubts, self criticism, anxiety, anger, lack of confidence, decision making, loss, search for harmony, inner peace, selflove. Your true Self is compassionate, confident, courageous. You will understand the inner battles "hijacking" your mind and be able to sense a true harmony behind them. The first session is free!! As you are able to connect with and accept yourself, you experience a sense of relief, harmony and power, the real you emerges as you hold yourself in unconditional love. The Law of Attraction - as taught by Esther &amp; Jerry Hicks - inform my practice.	6507411646	2016-05-05 01:05:17	2016-05-05 01:05:17
97	6647	Brian Winkler	For over 27 years, I have specialized in working with individuals and couples who are looking for a deep, transformative experience in therapy that resolves core issues and not just symptoms. I help my clients resolve and change deep seated negative patterns, facilitating a greater capacity for intimacy, joy, inner peace, and confidence. I draw upon several approaches including psychodynamic (childhood issues), Couples Systems, Jungian dream analysis, meditative practices, and EMDR for the rapid resolution of trauma. My style is warm and interactive. I will give you helpful, direct and honest feedback and not just sit and listen. I especially enjoy working with adults, teens, and couples going through a major life transition, recovering from trauma, or looking for renewed meaning and direction. What makes my work unique compared to many other therapists is that I do not take a striclty cognitive approach. Just talking about issues and understanding them better, although helpful, does not necessarily change them. I will help you resolve the core, subconscious patterns and causes of your problems.	6503068188	2016-05-05 01:05:23	2016-05-05 01:05:23
98	67638	Genevieve Johansen	Does your child look or act sad, worried or angry a great deal of the time? Is he or she having problems in school or with friends? Or perhaps he or she is being oppositional and you're unsure what to do about it. If you or your family is going through changes or facing stressors, such as loss, divorce/separation, family members having identity issues or communication problems then I can help. I work to assist you and your child in identifying barriers to sucess and happiness. Together, you and I will create plans for overcoming these barriers. Together we examine history, feelings and thoughts to increase insight and learn and practice more effective ways of coping. I use all means of self-expression including talk therapy, art therapy and writing to explore and cope with difficulties. I also use play therapy with young children to assist them in processing difficult events, especially children who have faced confusing changes in their lives such as divorce or loss.	6507147427	2016-05-05 01:05:33	2016-05-05 01:05:33
99	49673	Catherine Crawford	I bring empathy, compassion and 20+ years of experience to my work with women, children and teens.

101	204764	Amy Friedman	Kids and adolescents, adults and couples, and families are all welcome to my practice. In collaboration with you, I will help guide and support you in attaining your therapy goals by understanding the patterns that have been blocking your success, happiness and fulfillment. I will chart a therapeutic course building off concepts and bringing tools and techniques specific to who you are and what your goals are. I invite feedback and make corrections as needed along the way. My framework for understanding you is psychodynamic to which I bring training in cognitive and other theories/techniques. Although, my practice is general in nature, I have a couple of specializations. I enjoy working with late adolescents and young adults stepping toward the next phase of life. I have passion and compassion for working with parents of children of all ages, including adult children. I work well with people who are ambivalent about starting, or re-entering therapy.	6506660909	2016-05-05 01:05:55	2016-05-05 01:05:55
102	44129	Haleh Rambod	We constantly are faced with challenges of life, personal growth, relationships, and interaction with others. As we consciously make an effort to experience the humanness in us we become aware of our personal power. There are times when some challenges cannot be faced alone. We need to have a guide, a counselor, a coach to provide us with the tools to overcome these challenges. As a guide, I believe in my clients' potential for self discovery leading to life altering transformations. My clinical career has been focused on counseling children, adolescents, parents and individuals regarding trauma, personal, emotional, behavioral, educational, cross cultural, and crisis issues. I have been guiding parents, couples, individual and teens to manage life challenging issues and make healthy life style choices. I have received extensive training in working with children, teenagers and individuals with trauma. I also am a certified hypnotist and have helped clients with test taking anxiety, and stress management. I have always been attracted to the symbols and metaphors used in our dreams and sand play.	4086220125	2016-05-05 01:06:02	2016-05-05 01:06:02

104	58451	Nicholas Ney	Do you dream about a better life for yourself? A time and a place where your healthy self lines up with your best intentions and allows you to manifest new behavior? Can you believe you deserve this better life, but inner forces, such as anxiety, vagueness and low self-esteem, rise up and thwart you from attaining it? I specialize in helping individuals and couples find the courage to look at these and other stuck points. Two key areas of personal suffering I have some expertise with are money concerns and chemical dependency. Here"s a brief word about each: Whether you are financially secure for life, getting by comfortably, or struggling to keep up with your monthly expenses, I can help you manage your fears and find new answers. The same is true of chemical dependency challenges, whether you are battling abuse/dependency or are a concerned loved one. I am a clinical psychologist in private practice with over 18 years of licensed experience. I am on the adjunct clinical faculty of the Stanford University Department of Psychiatry. I have learned helpful strategies and tools that I can introduce you to so you may realize new and healthy choices.	6502097505	2016-05-05 01:06:23	2016-05-05 01:06:23
105	84551	Lyn Pock	Are you in a relationship in your life that isn't working for you? It could be your spouse,other family member, a friend, a colleague or your manager at work. You feel that it is difficult to deal with the person and you are often left feeling frustrated,irritated or sad and don't know what to do because you " have tried everything". This is a dysfunctional relationship that can benefit from my help as a therapist with a relationship specialty in couples and individual work. This kind of challenge can result in heartbreaking losses. For 23 years I supervised an outpatient department that primarily dealt with relationships. Relationships in crisis, separation/divorce. All difficulties that arise for alcoholics in recovery, adult children of alcoholics and codependents. All relations that have been altered as a result of the disease of alcoholism or any other hurtful cause. I help patients defeat repeating patterns of distressing thoughts that lead to painful feelings and unwanted behaviors. A psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral approach enables you to discover surprising things about yourself as I interpret, guide and lead you toward satisfying resolution to issues you brought to therapy.	6504407926	2016-05-05 01:06:29	2016-05-05 01:06:29

107	76072	Monica Stone	I can be most helpful to you if you are interested in growing yourself and your own potential for intimacy and sexuality, as an individual, or as a couple. Rather than identifying what's "wrong" with you, I work with you to identify your strengths and the ways that those strengths can be brought to bear on the challenges you are experiencing. My work involves assisting you (and your partner) to develop the capacity to balance your desire for autonomy with your desire for connection. It is by bringing those apparently opposite needs together, that you will reach your potential. I am an AASECT Certified Sex Therapist which means I have had extensive training in Human Sexuality. I also teach Human Sexuality to Counseling Psychology students at Santa Clara University. I have studied and trained with Dr. David Schnarch (author of Passionate Marriage) for over 15 years. I have extensive training in helping you and your partner to resolve "the common cold of marriage" desire discrepancy. Desire discrepancy means that one of you wants sex more often or more varied than the other. I see this as a natural process of marriage, rather than something going wrong.	6505167789	2016-05-05 01:06:38	2016-05-05 01:06:38
108	65809	Robert Williams	Are you a pretty successful, but feel like you have work to do on yourself? A YES suggests that you may want to work on a journey toward your highest self. In my work, your highest self is achieved through personal visioning, visualizing, practicing my Six Pillars of Wellness, managing change such that one is not controlled by circumstances, embracing six basic needs, and supporting a mindful approach to life roles (i.e., show up; pay attention; prepare to be in life roles; manage oneself in these roles; and pay attention to one's impact on others). I seek the highest possible self for my clients and for the people they encounter. Achieving the highest possible self is a life's journey, often full of real and false summits, which represent life's milestones. The highest possible self will rise above and transcend each summit and milestone. My San Mateo office is conveniently located, very private, and has ample parking. My hours are flexible for those with odd hours. I am a multiculturalist who accepts people just as they are. Yet, I am a student of you, your life, your family, and your circumstances.	4157872907	2016-05-05 01:06:40	2016-05-05 01:06:40
110	35989	Manning Psychological Services	Dr. Brad Manning's approach to therapy is one which focuses on helping individuals better understand, and learn to change, problematic thoughts, feelings &amp; behaviors. As every individual and situation is unique, the therapeutic goal and counseling techniques utilized are specifically tailored for each client.

111	121539	Dana Backstrom	Welcome. Chances are that you're looking for a professional you can talk with - either for yourself or someone you love. I provide emotional support, guidance and hope for those times when life becomes overwhelming, when you feel stuck, or when your life is heading in a new direction and you need encouragement. Whether you are seeking support for yourself, a family member, partner, friend etc... finding the right therapist is essential. One of my goals is to make quality counseling accessible, convenient and client friendly. We can meet in my Mountain View office, or I offer in-home appointments.

112	175182	Dorothy Adams	Most of my clients tell me that they feel totally accepted by me for who they are. I see people from all walks of life who are coping with diverse life situations including problems with depression, anxiety, life transitions, relationship problems issues in marriage, family problems and more. I believe that we all have a natural ability to improve our lives. I am here to assist that process by helping you to see that there is no problem that is too big to tackle, one step at a time. I enjoy working with adults who are in transition in either career, school, relationships or going through the process of aging and life changes. I also provide couples counseling. My approach is the Gottman method of marriage counseling which I have found to be very effective. The first step in therapy is by far the most difficult. That is why I make my office a safe place for you to talk about what is troubling you. My approach is that of a guide to my clients as they travel their own path in life.	6502043467	2016-05-05 01:06:55	2016-05-05 01:06:55
113	66153	Scott Granet	There's no question that psychotherapy is hard work for both the client and the therapist. I specialize in the treatment of the obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders(i.e., OCD, body dysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania, compulsive skin picking plus others), and know how challenging and frustrating the therapy can be at times. I work with my clients to develop an individualized treatment plan, designed to tackle each person's unique symptoms and needs. While these disorders are generally chronic in nature, the goal of more effectively managing the symptoms so someone can live a productive life is both reasonable and attainable. Treatment of the obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders requires a specialized approach which focuses on each individual's unique symptoms. Exposure and response prevention and habit reversal are the therapeutic interventions most successfully used in their treatment. In addition to my clinical work as a therapist, I have taught nationally on OCD, Body Dysmorphic Disorder, as well as other anxiety disorders. I have also presented at various conferences worldwide. I am a co-founder and former president of the Obsessive-Compulsive Foundation of the San Francisco Bay Area.	6502097530	2016-05-05 01:06:57	2016-05-05 01:06:57
114	111186	Kate Corcoran	I am a licensed clinical psychologist in Menlo Park, California, with extensive experience helping people overcome stress, anxiety, and depression. I specialize in CBT and mindfulness-based approaches, treatments which are effective in reducing distress and enhancing wellbeing. I am a Clinical Associate Professor at Stanford University and a founding partner of the Pacific Anxiety Group, a psychology clinic dedicated to providing evidence-based treatment for mood and anxiety disorders. Common difficulties that bring people to see me include anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety, work stress, perfectionism, depression, relationship difficulties, life transitions, and health-related concerns. My treatment approach combines CBT with mindfulness-based strategies. CBT is effective in helping people make important changes in their lives, with a focus on learning concrete strategies to deal with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Mindfulness-based treatments are effective in decreasing anxiety, relieving depression, and enhancing wellbeing.	6502907735	2016-05-05 01:06:59	2016-05-05 01:06:59
115	60544	Pacific Anxiety Group	I have specialized in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for adults with anxiety disorders for the past 10 years. My approach is both supportive and collaborative and is tailored to meet the needs of each client. I utilize the most up-to-date evidence-based treatment approaches, incorporating both CBT and acceptance-based strategies. I frequently work with individuals struggling with panic disorder/agoraphobia, social anxiety, phobias (e.g., fear of spiders), and worry. I also have extensive training in Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and frequently work with individuals with OC Spectrum Disorders. In addition to office visits, home-based treatment can be arranged for those seeking therapy for severe OCD, compulsive hoarding, agoraphobia, and other forms of anxiety/fear that occur in very specific environments. In addition to private practice, I am a clinical assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University and serve as clinical psychologist in the Stanford Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders Program.	6509953615	2016-05-05 01:07:01	2016-05-05 01:07:01
116	192439	Svetlana Kreimer	How does one move from a place of conflict, hopelessness, pain, and confusion to that of more freedom, peace, and acceptance? My hope is to answer this question together with my clients, seeing what works and what doesn't for each individual. I am an open-minded, warm, down-to-earth real, and affordable therapist, supporting people who are interested in improving their lives through introspection, self-awareness, creative expression, and genuine human connection. I am available and interested in working with you and your family; both traditional and nontraditional partnerships are welcome, and no issue is a taboo. I work with adult couples and individuals, and my office is well equipped for work with children, to whom I offer play therapy and a sand-tray. Whenever appropriate, my training as Expressive Arts therapist adds to our work some creative experiential tools such as art making or guided imagery. One of my strong interests is helping couples to maintain emotional and sexual connection in long-term relationships, often struggling with a lack of communication, infidelities, resentment... Another interest is cultural and ethnic identity, intercultural relationships, migration challenges. I have experience with Eastern European, Jewish, and Indian/South Asian communities.	4085123709	2016-05-05 01:07:03	2016-05-05 01:07:03
117	94545	Valerie Sher	When coping styles or life experiences challenge our ability to navigate the world, we often need a guide to help get a different perspective and learn new skills. Chronic distressful emotions/stress, burnout, negative inner dialogue, communication and relationship problems, problematic conflict styles, unmet needs/desires, trauma symptoms, and other difficulties lead to emotional distress and disease. Decode your emotions, manage stress/anxiety, cultivate wisdom, move from depression to finding your passion, resolve grief/trauma and help reclaim your joy, transform unhealthy habits, improve relationships while focusing on what's meaningful for a lifetime of self-awareness and acceptance. We get wounded in relationship, we get healed in relationship. My specialty focuses on relational health and the body's ability to manage stress, anxiety, rest, and be in healthy relationship with ourself/others -- relationship/sexuality, trauma resolution (sexual/physical abuse, early bonding issues, shock trauma), anxiety/stress, grief/loss. I use an eclectic approach that accesses the mind/body/spirit for a holistic approach to wellness. Tops down (cognitive/wisdom approaches), bottoms up (body symptoms/sensations, emotions, the unconscious) to discover parts of the psyche that want expression while holding the spiritual aspects of human existence and meaning making.	4086596645	2016-05-05 01:07:10	2016-05-05 01:07:10

120	131657	Pamela Singer	While there are many reasons people seek therapy, one thought is central: something has to change. Considering this idea takes tremendous courage. It can also bring tremendous reward. Change is not always easy, but it is possible. Therapy can be a powerful tool in this process by helping you gain insight, support, and confidence to develop new patterns and behaviors. As a clinical psychologist, I work collaboratively with people to identify the source of their pain and empower them to resolve it using evidenced-based treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, and mindfulness-based therapies. I have a special interest in working with disruptions of the mind-body connection, which often relate to trauma, eating disorders, and anxiety. With tools to help you stay present and master your nervous system, we can work together to greatly reduce the pain that accompanies a mind-body disconnect. I believe people are inherently strong and resilient, and can reconnect with those parts of themselves in environments where they are not judged, receive understanding, and work toward their own goals. I would welcome the opportunity to speak with you more about how I can assist you in your work.	6504890916	2016-05-05 01:07:18	2016-05-05 01:07:18
121	53317	Sarah Burdge	My ideal client is anyone who is willing and interested to understand themselves more fully. S/he will see therapy as a potentially long term process leading towards a more fulfilling and full life. S/he will be open to including spiritual inquiry at various points of the therapy as appropriate. Relationship is the foundation of any impactful therapeutic work, thus I work very relationally in addtion to existentialy, transpersonally and psychodynamically. I have extensive experience working with individuals with a history of trauma of all sorts. I enjoy working with individuals dealing with sexuality issues and/or cultural issues. I have a sold clinical background but am also trained in various transpersonal modalities. This allows me to be present with my clients in a more holistic matter.	6502748004	2016-05-05 01:07:20	2016-05-05 01:07:20

124	57064	Laura Hollands-Steck	I believe everyone deserves some time to sit down with a strong listener and/or problem solver about their life. The feedback that I receive is, that I empathize &amp; mirror the key issues quickly and help you brainstorm. I then help you get at "reframing" the negative situations and help you motivate and prioritize what is needed to do to actually change. I can work well with mood issues, chaos, panic, addictions and all relationship issues. Every session you should walk away with substantial suggestions to help in different areas.

126	201715	Alex Dimitriu	My primary focus is psychiatry with additional expertise in Sleep Medicine. With a thorough knowledge of psychopharmacology, I am able to find the most conservative and most effective medication regimens for my clients. Sleep and wake are the two most fundamental states of our lives and the basis for mood, anxiety, energy level, memory, and productivity. Expertise in both of these fields allows an integrated and holistic approach to treatment which leads to truly outstanding outcomes. I aim to practice state-of-the-art medicine, and to always remain rooted in the human side of the work that I do. The mind is the most elegant and complex system that we know of, and I feel privileged to devote my career in pursuit of its understanding. I completed my training at Stanford in Sleep Medicine. Through my fellowship, I fell in love with the people, natural beauty, and energy of the Bay Area. I finished my training with a comprehensive, round-the-clock understanding of the two most basic states of our lives; sleep and wake.	6502652158	2016-05-05 01:07:36	2016-05-05 01:07:36
127	143295	Yasmin Philipos	"She has a good life and nothing to complain about", one may say about you, but the truth is you feel lost and empty inside. You wonder, if you really opened up to your others, would they still hang around. You feel alone and anxious when surrounded by people. You want to have more of a drive to nurture yourself. You are not sure what holds you back. You want to start living, not just thinking about it. You are ready to thrive not survive - in your relationship with yourself and others. My speciality is working with girls and women struggling with anxiety, anger, and/or low self-esteem issues. As therapy progresses, my clients feel empowered to be the person they want to be - connecting with themselves and others in ways that reduce their symptoms. Having immigrated to the US from India 20 years ago, I am passionate about working with immigrants and multicultural families. l provide therapy services in Hindi too. I look forward to speaking with you! -Yasmin	6502298925	2016-05-05 01:07:38	2016-05-05 01:07:38

129	207105	Vidushi Savant	I have closely worked with and have a deep understanding of psychological needs of medically ill population. If you're someone who takes multiple medications for medical problems and need psychiatric care I could be the right Psychiatrist for you. Patients often feel uncertain about starting a new medication. I'm often asked "will this medication interact with my other medications?". I will work with you and help you decide if you need psychotropic medication(s). I only recommend starting medication when I believe it's likely to benefit you and am knowledgeable about medication interactions and side effects. I received my Psychosomatic Medicine subspecialty training at Stanford. I have experience managing medically ill patients with psychiatric needs. Some of the patients I see have cancer, HIV, organ failure, post-organ transplant, Multiple Sclerosis, Epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Diabetes, Dementia etc. I also see General Adult psychiatry patients.

I specialize in helping couples and individuals overcome the roadblocks they face in the most intimate aspect of their relationship: the intersection of their humanity and their sexuality.

133	43451	J Michael Priddy	With 20+ years of experience,, I have come to believe that what is most essential in therapy is the therapist-client connection. The first step is to establish a positive, mutually respectful working relationship. I work best within an open, consultative framework. I also maintain a part-time practice in Los Altos on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I currently supervise a psychological assistant who is available to see clients on a reduced fee basis, and also offer, in conjunction with a colleague, a five-week "fast-track" couples intensive program. Call or email for more information. I strongly believe in the uniqueness of each individual, and do not adhere to the one-size-fits-all approach. I find myself bringing a sense of humor and some residual East Coast practicality to my work. I also like to look beyond a resolution of the current problem to deeper patterns. The best therapy transcends simply dealing with the immediate issue to achieving a peace of mind and a sense of meaning and purpose in life.

Shame is a powerful impediment to opening, and I am expert at helping to untangle it. Trust me on this. I have worked successfully with brilliant and high-functioing CEOs and with people traumatized, addicted, and broke. Our work in this human family is challenging, and, with support, navegable. The practices of yoga and meditation (20+ years) and the clarity they have brought me are the foundation of my work. The issues I have worked with deeply include relationship struggles, parenting, grief, addiction, Anxiety, Depression, Panic Disorder, and spiritual crises, and co-occurring disorders. My practice is greatly influenced by Re-evaluation Counseling, Non-Violent Communication, Positive Discipline Parenting. When we risk being seen by another, we see ourselves in a new light, and the impossible is suddenly the inevitable.

Change does not come without work, but it can come without struggle.	8313461195	2016-05-05 01:08:10	2016-05-05 01:08:10

142	90955	Phil Boissiere	I work best with clients that are motivated for change. I specialize in the treatment of adult ADHD/ADD, Couples/Marriages, and families in a very goal oriented and short term way. I believe therapy should be a useful learning and growing experience that provides clients with real life tools and skills they can use for a life time. The effect that disorders, such as ADD/ADHD can have on individuals, couples, and families is best treated through a goal oriented approach utilizing skills training, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and a focus on relationships. My direct approach is also especially helpful for anxiety, depression, and job/academic performance issues. Most of my clients find my approach empowering and a refreshing departure from previous therapy experiences. I work hard to address the clients present situation and help them move forward.	4157994464	2016-05-05 01:08:27	2016-05-05 01:08:27
143	171888	Maria Porch	Are you struggling in your relationships with others, or with how you view yourself? Do you have problems at work, or are you grappling with a loss? Many times we may feel unhappy, or bland but are not clear about the causes and what we can do. Personal growth is a lifelong process, and at times, choosing to embark in a psychotherapeutic relationship can help. We all have the capacity to better understand ourselves and improve our lives. In our work together, you would begin to understand the relationship you have with yourself and how you navigate other relationships. I have found following your lead is of utmost importance. I work with a warm and nonjudgmental style and have worked with clients of diverse ethnic, cultural, gender, and sexual orientation backgrounds. I offer insight oriented psychodynamic and psychoanalytic psychotherapy, and use a strengths based perspective with clients. I work with adults, adolescents, and families. Parenting and growing up can be tough, and no amount of training can prepare us for all of its challenges. Asking for help can be difficult, but is the first step towards an improved life.	4088313959	2016-05-05 01:08:29	2016-05-05 01:08:29

There is a great deal of healing power in finding someone you feel is attuned to your concerns and supports you in grappling with them.	6509674995	2016-05-05 01:08:36	2016-05-05 01:08:36

I supplement my biologic conceptualization of mental illness with my deep understanding of psychoanalytic thought, which enables me to think holistically about the human experience and pathologies that may arise. I only recommend medications when medically necessary. I am very cognizant of side effects and and so try to keep regimens simple when possible. I like to meet people where they are, and think together with them to tailor an individual treatment plan that fits their needs. I treat the entire spectrum of mental illness through an integrative approach -- with medications, psychotherapy and alternative treatments as needed. I have had extensive training in psychodynamic psychotherapy, substance use disorders, OCD, Anxiety, Adult ADHD, Schizophrenia, Bipolar, PTSD, and Depression.

148	72924	Joyce Schmid	My typical client is an adult of exceptional intelligence, creativity, achievement, and kindness, who needs to address problems in his or her life. These problems include depression, anxiety, the disease of addiction, childhood trauma,the addictions of others, and/or difficulties in forming or enjoying relationships. Too many people emerge from childhood with wounds from parental loss, abuse, or neglect. Some carry genetic loadings for addiction. The aftermath of these is devastating, despite success and "looking good." Revealing the pain to another person and revising basic assumptions about yourself and others in a safe relationship can help. I will be interested in your current life, your history and memories, your hopes for the future, your dreams and fantasies, and the relationship that develops between you and me. Understanding these will help you understand yourself, so that you can take the risks necessary for growth. My background includes a B.A. from Harvard, a Ph.D. from PGSP (now Palo Alto University), internships at Kaiser and Stanford, a staff psychotherapist position at Stanford, and over twenty years in private practice. I have published articles and book chapters on addiction, and have taught classes for therapists.	6502097773	2016-05-05 01:08:48	2016-05-05 01:08:48

150	132116	Judith Gable	As a therapist in practice for over 30 years it is always an honor for me to help facilitate and witness the therapeutic process that helps my clients come to more fully understand and appreciate themselves and attain their personal goals. I am highly attuned to the unique needs of each of my clients. I work in a dynamic and collaborative fashion using the therapeutic relationship and process to help you move forward in your life. Some common therapeutic goals are: diminish anxiety &amp; depression; gain greater insight into feelings &amp; behaviors; feel freed up to make better choices and changes in your life ; increase self-esteem ;become more effective and satisfied in your work; feel more empowered to ask for and get what you need; and engage in healthier, more satisfying relationships. Finding the right match in a therapist is critical. I often recommend that people interview a number of therapists in order to find the one that feels right. I can provide referrals as needed. I look forward to hearing from you.	6502412066	2016-05-05 01:08:58	2016-05-05 01:08:58
151	236277	Nancy Morgan	Therapy for individuals and couples whose lives have been impacted by destructive emotions, behaviors, and beliefs; individuals who, despite their best efforts, are experiencing happiness and stability as elusive ideals. In therapy I engage clients in the process of unburdening; transforming negative beliefs and impressions into positive inner resources. The process itself supports healing and allows for life-changing shifts to occur, both while in therapy and after. Just as our bodies know how to heal physical injuries, each of us also possesses the innate capacity to heal from emotional injuries. I integrate therapeutic modalities, and provide structure and support throughout the change process. You are much more than your present circumstances suggest. Growth and stability are possible. I offer clinical supervision to post-doctoral psychology interns, and management training, development, and consultation services. RECENT PRESENTATIONS: Oregon Counseling Assn.

152	72995	Barbara Finn	Welcome! I work primarily with high functioning adults, couples, and groups who are encountering stress and/or difficulties in their interpersonal relationships, either in the work setting, at home, or both. This includes people experiencing depression, anxiety, personality disorders, and those dealing with adjustment issues related to recent changes in their life-- for example, divorce, blended families, job change, birth of a child, relationships with in-laws, money issues, etc. I believe it is the healthy, not the unhealthy people who come into my office for psychotherapy. From my perspective, anyone who's willing and able to engage in this process is demonstrating immense courage to do what many aren't willing to do. I place a high value on honesty and authenticity. While kind and caring, I am also direct and straightforward. I tend not to beat around the bush.	6502097917	2016-05-05 01:09:04	2016-05-05 01:09:04

153	149799	Naina Sodhi	An approach I find successful is, having individually crafted treatment goals that are worked on using various modalities. With compassion and insight, together we will achieve the growth or resolution that each opportunity brings. In a safe and supportive environment, we will examine and change current or long held issues. You deserve to be functioning at your best potential. Culture, community, family, spirituality and our experiences create a complex network for our existence - all essential to our functioning and useful as resources. We walk our whole lives in order to reach the present moment, when new choices and new paths can begin or old ones honed.

154	214317	Nina Keebler	Life is a journey full of ups and downs. It doesn't come with a roadmap, and at times we all find ourselves in difficult situations. As your therapist, I will guide you and support you through these rough times by illuminating the path to healing and wholeness. In the face of life's challenges, our tendency is to cope, adapt and get by. Unfortunately some of these coping mechanisms are outdated and no longer serve us, so we go about life just "getting by". Rather than merely "surviving" you could be thriving. Together, I will help you break through your limiting beliefs and old patterns so you can rediscover your passion for life and experience greater joy and well being. With a warm, compassionate and insightful approach, you will learn to navigate the process of transformation. I use both intuitive and evidence-based modalities such as mindfulness and EMDR. Prior to becoming a therapist, I worked as a Consultant at Insigniam coaching executives of large corporations and non-profits. I also bring 20 years of experience with children to my practice.	6508303141	2016-05-05 01:09:17	2016-05-05 01:09:17
155	158770	Hagit Zeev	Hi and welcome! In my practice I treat people who are searching for deeper meaning and want to grow. I see life as a journey and therapy as support in challenging intersections. I work on deepening self awareness and mindfulness to solve inner conflicts. I have successfully worked with people struggling with stress issues, anxiety, trauma, grief and life transitions. In my own self work, I've learned to be in the present moment, allowing what needs to unfold to come forth without judgement. My training includes study and practice in the areas of IFS (Internal Family Systems), EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique), Yoga Psychology and Humanistic Existential Psychology.	6508263092	2016-05-05 01:09:19	2016-05-05 01:09:19

My goal is to unearth the place where you are already whole. Our therapy together will heal and transform the obstacles preventing you from living a life of joy, completness and fulfillment.	4159693024	2016-05-05 01:09:22	2016-05-05 01:09:22

Hypnotherapy can be effective in building a bridge between the conscious mind and subconscious mind in order to explore the source and solutions of emotional, mental, and physical issues. This expanded state of consciousness allows for genuine realizations and the motivation to implement lasting transformations. I welcome the opportunity to empower you in your healing journey through Hypnotherapy and also share techniques such as EFT, NLP, guided imagery and relaxation.

As a solution-focused therapist, my goal is to help you develop the insight and skills to identify, access, and apply those resources to move toward your goals and lead a happier, healthier life and enjoy richer and more satisfying relationships.

160	11713	Debora Burgard	Finding a therapist is such a leap of faith. It is one of life's challenges that at a time when you might feel the most vulnerable, you also have the least information about whether someone can help! I'm told I'm good person to talk to if something is bothering you and you want to figure it out. I try to support that inner flame of resilience in the face of all the challenges. I am one of the founders of the Health at Every Size (HAES) and Body Positive movements. May you find a good match!

161	173368	Wes Pederson	I have a down to earth, straight forward style, and use an integrative approach to therapy that is grounded in my Existential-Humanistic orientation. I also offer Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Radically Open DBT (RO-DBT) for clients struggling with substance abuse, chronic depression or anxiety, long standing life and relationship issues, suicidal thoughts/behavior, or related problems. In my work with clients, I generally focus on expanding awareness of self-in-relationship, ability to be present to feeling states, release of long-held emotional patterns, and development of essential life and coping skills. My primary area of focus is the process of self-realization, or embodying one's authentic self in the deepest and most effective sense. This has been the focus of my research and personal practice for many years, and I believe is the most valuable thing I offer my clients. Please feel free to call me for a free consultation. I would be more than happy to discuss what has you looking for support and whether I may be a good fit for you.	6506459802	2016-05-05 01:09:47	2016-05-05 01:09:47
162	33090	David Mineau	The focus of my practice is in helping couples, families and individuals turn painful conflict into a means of growth. By teaching new skills and helping each person articulate the difficult emotionsand needs underlying their fights, I believe I can help couples and families create more satisfying relationships. I try to create a climate of safety and trust by listening very carefully, refusing to take sides, capitalizing on small changes, pointing out the positives and encouraging the expression of need and desire.

163	79976	Sharon Greenberg	Looking for a psychologist is difficult. It is important to find someone who is a close match with your needs. I approach therapy with an active style, providing direct feedback in a supportive manner. For more than twenty years, I have been successfully helping individuals and couples find greater enjoyment in life. For therapy to work, I believe that the therapist needs to care about, and feel connected to, the individuals he or she works with. Psychotherapy is not just a job; helping people get better and live their life in a fuller happier way is something I strive for. My areas of specialization include: depression and anxiety, stress management, marital and couples therapy, eating disorders: compulsive or bulimia, parenting issues, adolescents, alcoholism, and adult children of alcoholics. I also work well with individuals coping with infertility, and adults were sexually or physically abused in childhood, and interpersonal group therapy. My style is to be active and responsive during the session. Unlike the media's standard portrayal of therapists, I don't believe in answering a question with a question. I provide interpretations of the client's inner experiences and behavior as appropriate. Click on link to website (homepage) above.	6502069963	2016-05-05 01:09:51	2016-05-05 01:09:51
164	124942	Claire Colaco	My first job as a therapist is to listen and understand. Deep listening is a time honored tradition and fundamental to healing. I strive to create a safe and nurturing relationship with clients that is a source of comfort and inspiration. Clients inspire me too! I practice spiritually grounded psychotherapy. This means I see life's challenges as, fundamentally, opportunities to grow spiritually and as a whole person. To me, the process of healing is beautiful and miraculous, something that gives us glimpses of a benevolent force much greater than ourselves. I have experience working with adults, couples, families and children. I bring a variety of healing modalities to my work that help to integrate and build mind/body/spirit awareness. These include: working with the unconscious, mindfulness training, somatic techniques, dream work, cognitive behavioral therapy, and behavioral modification utilizing goal setting. My areas of expertise include: Depression/Anxiety; Life Transitions; Eating Issues/Body Image Concerns; Spirituality; Parenthood; Children with Behavioral and Emotional Difficulties; Survivors of Childhood Abuse; and Neglect Marriage/Partnership	9713402718	2016-05-05 01:09:54	2016-05-05 01:09:54
165	138035	Jerod Gilbert	Are you concerned about your relationship with your partner, your children, or your job? Have you tried to figure it out but can't seem to make sense of why things aren't working? Do the evenings and weekends with your family seem like a chore? Do you feel stuck and want to do something but don't know what to do? Somatic psychotherapy is a way of getting things moving, feeling more connected to yourself and to your world, and creating the space you need to grow and thrive! I work with supporting the social and emotional needs of gifted adolescents and adults. My skills and interests best serve those of you who seek: * Work / life balance * Parenting and relationship skills * Support with anxiety and depression * Support with maximizing your strengths and fulfilling your goals.

249	231660	Kristi Yeh	After working in the corporate world I realized something was missing, so I sought a career path that I was passionate about. With service, relationships, and personal growth being my biggest motivators I began working in the therapy world.

167	147619	Jen Berlingo	With compassion &amp; creativity, I support women seeking meaning and growth. As both a licensed counselor and art therapist, I invite both verbal and visual processing into therapy sessions. Many clients prefer solely talk therapy, which is powerful in itself. However, the adult intellect can be adept at keeping old patterns intact (even ones that keep us stuck.) Art bypasses verbal limitations, allowing ah-ha moments to come safely and clearly. I delight in helping women during any stage of transformation and self-discovery, with emphases in perinatal psychology and supporting other helping professionals in mindfulness and self-care practices. As a graduate of Naropa, a Buddhist university for contemplative study, I hold space for clients with transpersonal tenets of unconditional acceptance, compassion, and basic sanity. My approach focuses on psychological wellness rather than pathology. I work holistically, employing techniques such as art therapy, visualization, dream work, mindfulness, and ritual. I am also available for art therapy supervision (toward ATR) and Reiki sessions. In addition to my private practice, I facilitate mother's blessing ceremonies as a sacred and artful way to honor the rite of passage of becoming a parent.

168	33557	James Hutt	Do you experience difficulty managing conflict in your relationship? Maybe one of you has an anger problem, or you withdraw during conflict. Maybe it's time to re-light the flame. Perhaps parenting struggles, particularly with teenagers, are wearing you out. Or, you cannot agree on parenting techniques. Maybe substance abuse is hurting you or a loved one, and you want help addressing it. I have 30 years experience dealing with couple/marital, parenting and substance abuse issues. Learn practical solutions that can help reduce these, and other stressors in your life. I can help you deal effectively with parenting issues related to divorce, and show you and your former partner how to achieve parenting cooperation. As an adult or child adoptee, you might experience difficulty with trust and relationships, or the family has trouble talking about adoption. Now is the time to figure out how to manage that sensitive subject in an effective way.	6509185875	2016-05-05 01:10:13	2016-05-05 01:10:13

170	50032	Kali Hess	When your life is painful and you have worries that overwhelm you, it helps to speak with someone who can help you experience your life and relationships from a new perspective. You and I will collaborate to bring about shifts in thoughts and feelings that can promote a more creative engagement with life, better connections with the people around you, and the ability to make better choices. I have over 20 years experience in treating the depression and anxiety that come from ways of being and thinking that have become damaging.	6503858880	2016-05-05 01:10:23	2016-05-05 01:10:23
171	34780	Stacy O	Individual therapy-- Are you struggling with anxiety/stress; trauma/past abuse; grief/loss; or alcohol/addiction problems? You can learn tools that help you feel calmer, more grounded, and more in control of your life. Therapy can help if you are feeling stuck, struggling with a past or present issue, or having trouble reaching your goals. It can be frustrating and painful to experience anxiety, stress, trauma, grief, or addiction, but you can feel better. My primary goal is to help people get back to living and enjoying their lives as soon as possible. I have learned many effective techniques, but not every technique fits for every person. Depending on your needs, I offer traditional counseling/talk therapy, EMDR, hypnosis or guided meditation, mindfulness skills, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and NLP. You can use just one approach or a blend of approaches. Please visit my website at TherapyMountainView.com for more information (website link above). I offer a free initial phone consultation, so that you can ask any questions you may have and decide if we are a good fit.

172	62190	Tom Hall	Addictive technologies, the pull of the peer group, and economic uncertainty make our role as parents more, not less, important. And while problems with friendship, academic issues, and concerns about discipline are common areas of concern I find that helping parents to simultaneously recognize the effect of these larger societal changes to be equally important in improving our parenting roles. Many referrals come from pediatricians and school counselors but mainly they come from friends of families whom I have helped. To get a feeling about how I work and my commitment, read the "Client Letters" section on my website. I work with boys and girls of all ages and relate as easily to a four-year-old as to a fourteen-year-old. I welcome parent feedback between sessions and make myself available between sessions as concerns or questions arise. In addition to "talk therapy", I utilize a variety of "play therapy" techniques, especially with less verbal younger children or those who are initially uncomfortable talking about the issues they're wrestling with. These techniques include: stop-motion animation, magic tricks, clay, sand tray, drawing, puppetry, story writing, and bibliotherapy.	6505210347	2016-05-05 01:10:28	2016-05-05 01:10:28
173	109771	Eric Fitzmedrud	I am accepting new clients. I have afternoon and evening availability. I am a licensed psychologist and I provide psychotherapy for individuals and couples. I provide a comfortable professional atmosphere where we can work together to improve your relationships, put your past behind you, help you become the romantic and sexual partner you want to be, decrease your symptoms, increase your coping skills, and/or help you accomplish your life goals. I have an active style that helps clients stop negative emotional patterns and begin using new skills during sessions. Call for a 15-minute consultation. To help you with romantic relationship difficulties, I start by hearing about the challenge, enhancing the reasons to hope, and developing at least one new thing to do after the 1st session so you can begin making improvements as soon as possible. I love working with clients with all types of sexual diversity. As a diversity-minded therapist, I know it can be important to have a therapist who knows about the history, values, and experience of your community. I also know that your experience of your diversity is unique.	6503858817	2016-05-05 01:10:32	2016-05-05 01:10:32
174	210170	Tessa Fisher	It's hard to accept you're at a point in your life where you're feeling stuck and you need help. And it takes courage to ask for it. My goal is to create a safe, non-judgemental space in which to help you explore the issues that brought you into therapy. To discover together the underlying patterns of thinking and acting which perpetuate your suffering. And to work towards increased awareness and achievement of your most deeply-felt personal goals. My approach is solution-focused and interactive, identifying and helping you build on your strengths. I work primarily with people suffering from depression, anxiety and relationship/interpersonal issues, integrating psychodynamic, relational and cognitive behavioral approaches. Being able to think about who you really are and what really matters to you, opens the door to a more authentic way of being, giving you greater strength to manage life's challenges. Please contact me if you would like to explore working together.	6602624786	2016-05-05 01:10:41	2016-05-05 01:10:41

176	102289	Eman Fallah	I have more than twenty years of training in healing methods from Eastern and Western Psychology and have helped many hundreds relieve debilitating stress, depression, and anxiety so that they may more fully tap into their own inner strengths and resources. I specialize in cutting edge methods such as Gendlin's Focusing, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy and Buddhist Psychology. I offer an effective integrated approach in therapy and coaching. I work mainly with people going through life transitions, addictions/compulsions, and identity crises.

177	34684	Francis Abueg	Warmth, supportiveness and professional integrity are three principal values which have guided over 30 years experience in mental health. I have had a longstanding focus on trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dissociation, addictions to substances (alcohol, drugs and prescription medications) and to self-destructive behavior (anger, the internet, gambling). My emphasis is on providing accurate diagnoses of current psychological problems and addressing those problems with techniques that are research and/or evidence-based. Clients consistently report rapid relief in fewer than 10 sessions; however, many clients pursue further therapy, making dramatically positive and often unexpected changes in their lives. My approach is problem-centered which builds each person's confidence through immediate, measurable easing of emotional difficulties. I use techniques drawn from cognitive behavioral and psychodynamic therapy in treating anxiety, depression, phobias, dissociative disorder and PTSD. Meaning, purpose and spirituality in life are also issues often considered in therapy with me. I have worked with survivors of extreme trauma including 14 years at the VA with veterans of Vietnam, Korea, World War II and the Persian Gulf Wars. My recent practice has included adults surviving abuse as children; workplace threat evaluations, accidents, critical incidents; motor vehicle accidents and sexual assault.	4083372953	2016-05-05 01:10:52	2016-05-05 01:10:52

179	32866	Carol Williams	I work with adults, teens, and children; in individual, couple, and family therapy. My experience is largely with mood and anxiety disorders (particularly Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder).

I partner with physicians in helping people live well with chronic pain or chronic medical conditions. I also have expertise in family work - helping people to negotiate the challenges of divorce and remarriage, and enhancing the lives of intercultural and interracial families. My approach is grounded in cognitive-behavioral, family systems, and attachment theories. I offer a mindfulness-based approach which includes attention to the interplay of thought, emotion, body, and spirit. I have been practicing Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)since 1998 and have seen many clients benefit from it. I also offer sensorimotor interventions and Lifespan Integration.

180	147040	Edna Stok	Feeling overwhelmed? stuck? hurt? lost? Maybe you're searching for a deeper sense of meaning or purpose in your life? Or maybe you're close to losing hope - wondering if things will always be like this, falling into the same cycles over and over again? Since you are reading these lines, you are taking the first step towards change. I work with adults, couples, teens, and children who are seeking support, growth, meaning, and change in their relationships and lives.

181	40476	Dena Anthony	Lacking pleasure and fulfillment, life turns anxious and desolate. When problems fester untended, they undermine zest, dampening our inner life force. A primary tool toward inner healing and growth is finding the essential meaning in your life. This requires learning who you are underneath the defenses and barriers that have been necessary for safety. In psychotherapy we form a relationship in which it is safe to talk about who you are and how you experience the world around you. Consequently you may come to know and appreciate yourself more deeply, and find the meaning that will give your life gusto. In therapy inner adaptive forces become available to foster healing. We will explore the roots of your issues and conflicts within the powerful therapeutic context of a confidential and safe relationship. Next I will help you develop the skills you need in order to cultivate dynamic, passionate engagement with life. My doctoral research explored the effects of companies' poor management practices on the mental and emotional health of people who work there. My experience includes 25 years in corporate and academic positions as mathematics professor, builder/director of corporate technical training organizations and mother of three -- now enjoying five grandchildren.	6509249770	2016-05-05 01:11:04	2016-05-05 01:11:04

205	72792	Laura Hamilton	The burning question: "Should I be concerned by my child's behavior, lack of communication, or new friends... or is this just a phase"? There are many variables as to why children/adolescents begin acting differently and sometimes this is just a natural progression in your child becoming their own individual. However, other times these are warning signs that something problematic is involved and you are correct to be concerned. I have over fifteen years of clinical experience helping kids figure out how they can feel more in control of themselves, thus helping to improve behavior, school problems, self-esteem, anger, anxiety, grief/loss/bereavement, eating disorders and communication issues.

My ideal client is the person who is ready to take a real hard look at them-self, and they respond to the safe space that I provide in order to begin the therapeutic work . I normally work with individuals, children or adolescents, however, in my practice I find that the issues of the individual is the issue of the family . I also work with the more common issues of depression and anxiety, and in many cases, these two issues are often part of other ongoing challenges like substance abuse or gambling, domestic violence and child abuse, parenting issues and custody disputes, and academic and intellectual challenges. In addition to my clinical practice, I also provide mental health assessments and evaluations for immigration cases with regards to Visa U, Political Asylum and deportation hardship waiver cases.

Eating disorders create significant challenges for teens and their families in all aspects of their lives. Sometimes these challenges require intensive treatment. Through our multidisciplinary approach, we address physical, emotional, and nutritional health, academic functioning, and family and peer relationships. Our goal is to provide holistic care that supports adolescents and their families in finding new and healthy ways of living. So often, teens with eating disorders and their families feel isolated and alone. Our program provides structure and support. It gives clients a chance to connect, relate and problem solve with others that struggle with similar issues. We help guide families in supporting their loved ones in a safe and caring way.  <h3>Why adolescent only treatment?</h3> The Healthy Teen Project believes a teenager-only therapeutic environment is important when treating teens with eating disorders as teens have specific needs that are different than those of adults: Family support - with teens, family support and therapy is an integral component, both for nutritional rehabilitation and to explore other challenges of adolescence and mental health. Group therapy and support from their peers - group therapy allows teenagers to find a place where they can open up and be honest and real about their struggles, relate to others, and receive much needed support. Teenagers are at very different places in life than adults and it is other teenagers that provide the validation and support they require. Greater focus on behavioral and experiential opportunities vs. cognitive/verbal skills Teenagers get more out of "doing" rather than "talking about doing". At HTP, teenagers are actively engaged in experiential opportunities and behavioral approaches, such as art therapy, yoga therapy, meal preparation and restaurant exposures. Additionally, HTP provides a teen-oriented environment where teens can feel safe, nurtured and hopeful. By not treating adolescents along side adult peers, HTP is able to provide the interventions specific to teens with eating disorders.  <h3>The Healthy Teen Project Team</h3> Our multidisciplinary team consists of professionals with medical, psychiatric, therapy and nutritional backgrounds. Together our team has over 75 years of treating eating disorder patients across a range of environments including: in-patient medical and psychiatric hospitalization, residential treatment centers, partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient programs, as well as outpatient clinics.	6502414052	2016-05-05 01:12:40	2016-05-05 01:12:40
208	21554	Rachel Veronneau	Good therapy involves the right match. I also provide a free 30 minute (in person) question and answer session (not counseling). This allows you to understand what your therapy process will look like. If we decide to work together, you will be involved in a very action oriented therapy. Our work will encourage you to practice your new skills during the week. I try to use approaches that you find helpful like: writing in a journal, reading books, support groups, and/or your spiritual practices, that may help while you are in therapy. New blog:therapist.and.mother@blogspot.com I use a multi-theory approach and rely heavily on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Techniques. We will look at how your thoughts, feelings and behaviors are connected. Together we will try to help you break out of old patterns. This means that you will be involved in goal setting! Since 1983 I have worked with children, teenagers, and adults in educational, hospital, and community settings. I specialize in problems of Chemical Dependency and Recovery, Learning Disabilities, Crisis, Depression, Domestic Violence, Employment, Life Transitions, Women's Issues, Family Counseling, Spiritual Crisis, Couples Counseling and Pre-Marital Counseling.

209	104729	Kirsten Harnett	As a therapist I believe each person has the capability and potential of living outside the bounds of fear, anxiety, apathy, and/or depression if they so desire. I see my role as both collaborator and guide, bearing witness to my client's stories and helping grow insight so new, more empowering stories might be written. I do this using several techniques including changing maladaptive, deeply ingrained thinking/feeling/behavior patterns, and exploring challenging childhood, family, and relationship history. I have experience treating issues of anxiety, depression, destructive relationship patterns, and clients with painful spiritual experiences they want assistance healing. While I have a range of experience, my specialty involves work with individual, single adults who have experienced trauma or challenge in their dating lives and/or carry pain associated with the unmet desire to be married. This starting point often leads to deep exploration of family and childhood history.	4157234131	2016-05-05 01:12:44	2016-05-05 01:12:44
210	264771	Julia Tisdale	I help young professionals live a more satisfying life and solve problems. I can help clients in clarifying relationships, defining career goals and decisions, and healing depression and anxiety. Clients leave therapy with an overall better understanding of themselves. I have been studying Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP) for the past two years. ISTDP is an active form of therapy where the therapist assists the client in seeing the ways they are harming themselves, blocking themselves from reaching their full potential or damaging their relationships. I also have experience working with the adolescent population and their families. I spent last year counseling middle school students and families with issues related to academics,relationships, and mental health. I look forward to helping more adolescents and their parents find confidence, happiness and compassion for themselves and others.	6504450326	2016-05-05 01:12:47	2016-05-05 01:12:47
211	264677	Lisa Renae Nelson	Would you like to find your way back to joy and your authentic Self? Would you like to try psychotherapy, in nature? Are you struggling with anxiety, depression, grief, co-dependency, trauma, social disengagement, or is your life not working out the way you'd like? At my small Woodside ranch, I offer equine facilitated psychotherapy, where the horse is included in the session. Equines, being prey animals, pick up subtle, often unconscious cues and emotions, frequently before you are aware of it yourself. Horses reflect your emotions back without judgement or words; they are non-threatening teachers and friends. This experiential treatment modality works well due to the equine's extreme sensitivity to emotional changes in humans. The equine responds to individuals in the moment, based on the person's emotional state; they are a living biofeedback machine. This information allows for processing and addressing issues for the client I also provide standard office therapy and EMDR. Sometimes changing therapeutic modalities helps in exploring and addressing a fuller spectrum of issues. Because equine facilitated psychotherapy is a modality unfamiliar to many, I offer a complimentary 30 minute "Meet and Greet" to see if this modality works for you.	6502651676	2016-05-05 01:12:53	2016-05-05 01:12:53
212	63432	Wei-Chien Lee	Imaging how you would feel and act when you have a better and more stable mood, greater relationships, more self-acceptance and esteem, more freedom (from regrets, past, etc), and a healthier mind ... You just took the first step to change! I will help you gain the skills and knowledge in taking the next steps, making progresses, and achieving your goals - in a respectful, direct, no-nonsense, non-judgmental, sincere, and supportive way. This process may be challenging (as it should be), but I've helped created and witnessed numerous victorious smiles -- and, you will create yours. Many colleagues and clients comment that I am a "gifted" psychologist and genuinely care about my clients. I am specialized in helping people with depression, bipolar disorder, worries, eating disorders, and interpersonal/relationship and self-esteem/confidence issues. I also have extensive training and experiences in marital/couple counseling. My skills and knowledge are well-recognized -- I regularly provide training to psychologists and therapists. I have also given 25+ presentations at professional conferences. However, I consider people's heart and my passion in helping people actualize their potentials most valuable and essential parts of therapy.	4086221903	2016-05-05 01:13:01	2016-05-05 01:13:01
213	132841	Terri Zucker	As a clinical health psychologist, I treat both psychological and medical conditions They are often connected. Increasing both your emotional and physical well-being will give you more mental clarity. We then figure out how your thoughts, emotions, and life events are impacting you physical and mental health. As a client you become a partner in your own healing. The evidence-based treatments provided are Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, and coping skills. Coping skills include biofeedback, breathing, muscle relaxation, mindfulness, and restorative yoga. I treat older adults 18-90+. I believe that ones unique personal history and cultural mix affects health. About insurance: I employ a billing specialist-- to eliminate uncertainty and headaches. She will verify your eligibility, obtain authorization for deductibles, co-pays, and bill your insurance. You pay the co-payment only; you need not bill your insurance. PPO's and Out-of-network clients are usually reimbursed well.	6504890765	2016-05-05 01:13:03	2016-05-05 01:13:03
214	107383	Claudine Radford	"Vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage." - Brené Brown Ph.D. LMSW. Whether you have decided to try therapy for the first time, or are returning in a different phase of your life, this leap can feel incredibly vulnerable. Finding and building a trusted therapeutic relationship, has the potential to guide you towards deep healing, and positive change. I am committed to the process of curiosity and transformation with all my clients. This work is incredibly deep, challenging, and ultimately profound. I hope to support you to safely explore your inner landscape, so that you are able to live with more resilience and joy. With compassion, pragmatism, and humor, I support my clients to address present moment "stuck-ness" that is typically rooted in depression, anxiety, trauma, and grief. What emerges is often a deeper self-understanding, optimized energy and time, and an overall experience of vitality and well-being. I am a strong believer in holistic health care. I collaborate with integrative professionals and medical doctors, in my work with clients, to create a successful network of support.	4155346277	2016-05-05 01:13:10	2016-05-05 01:13:10

Are you looking for ways to help your children without them feeling that something is wrong with them and needs to be fixed? I specialize in working with adults and children who have found themselves “out-of-the-box” in one way or another, whether that be high sensitivity or learning, neurological, or physical differences, gender expression or sexual orientation and expression, or simply an unconventional experience and expression of life. My work is body-centered and resource-based. I help you build internal and external resources to effectively and creatively meet life and be who you want to be. I use a mindful, heart-centered approach to resolve hurts and develop strategies for coping with all that life presents. I welcome the unique and authentic in each person and relationship and honor the ways that each person, by being themselves, opens up more room in the world. I offer a free introductory session so that you can see whether my approach is a good fit for you.	8312165386	2016-05-05 01:13:13	2016-05-05 01:13:13

220	59492	Dorian Manke	My job is to begin where you are and help you prepare for your next stage of change. I use an integrative approach, working from the inside out (objects relations, family systems, cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, others) to support your process and movement. We all start with assumptions about life. Then life happens, and we have to begin again having been changed. Loss becomes growth as we embrace new and mature understanding of ourselves and life. I am a clinical psychologist with over 10 years experience working with complicated but interesting people who are addressing individual, relationship, life, and spiritual issues. My service also includes a wide range of proactive life enhancements (e.g. marriage building; career development). When working with couples, I use the Gottman method. These approaches are grounded in theory and supported by research. Whatever the immediate problem, we will build a customized plan leading to new awareness and resilience. Insight oriented approaches or Cognitive work are best for some, skill training (mood regulation, interpersonal skills building, career path work) work for others, and adult sand tray work and art therapy are best for certain others. Spirituality is an important part of therapy for many.	6502412403	2016-05-05 01:13:42	2016-05-05 01:13:42
221	238454	Colleen Cunningham	I appreciate working with people who for whatever reason feel change tugging on them. Sometimes this "tug" may manifest as a crisis in one's life. I believe that some of the most profound changes are initiated through what are experienced as a crisis. My role as your therapist is to establish a relationship with you which honors and supports you as you begin the extraordinary journey of learning more about yourself, and the options that life has for you. I whole heartedly believe in, and trust the role therapy plays in our lives. Healing does happen. "Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes." -Carl Jung	6505427093	2016-05-05 01:13:45	2016-05-05 01:13:45
222	129043	Timothy Baima	I specialize in working with families, couples, and children &amp; adolescents. I strive to form relationships with my clients built upon trust, authenticity and collaboration. Working together we are able to open and expand possibilities to heal from pain, transform destructive cycles, and grow towards richer, more satisfying lives and relationships. Relationships often get stuck because we are unaware of ways we have hurt others and been hurt ourselves. Sometimes our best efforts to make things better seem to exacerbate the problem. I work to raise insight, facilitate healing, and open possibilities to connect in more satisfying ways. I have found that clients are often struggling to shield themselves and their relationships from a relentless assault of external stressors. Not least among these are dynamics of power, cultural marginalization, inequality and discrimination. My therapy often supports couples and families in uniting together to increase resiliency and personal empowerment. I offer a free initial phone consultation or office visit. I believe everyone should be able to benefit from therapy regardless of income. If we are a good fit for working together, I am willing to see you for whatever amount you can afford. Please do not let finances hold you back from seeking help.	5102395972	2016-05-05 01:13:48	2016-05-05 01:13:48
223	88028	Hillary Sinnott	I specialize in working with clients who are (a) intelligent, (b) motivated, and (c) hard-working. My clients already have the raw talent needed to excel in life but they're not operating at their full capacity. Together, we team up to explore what's holding them back and strategize on ways of tackling the obstacles. When working with adults I look for hidden lifelong patterns that, once exposed, release the client from being bound to old ways of thinking and behaving. Oftentimes these patterns carry across different situations, such as work, personal relationships, and self-esteem. When working with teenagers I empower them to find their voice, individuate and own their power, and heal from the experiences that have detracted from their confidence in themselves. For my clients, therapy is a place where their ideas, core personality, and preferences are given room to shine and grow.	6505675879	2016-05-05 01:13:50	2016-05-05 01:13:50

232	47222	Helene Brun	Greetings. My clients seek my help when relationships or personal problems drain peace and creativity from otherwise rewarding lives and careers. They don't want to worry or stay stuck and sad for long. Weekday and weekend appointments available. In most cases I favor short term counseling for individuals and couples, but do long term when appropriate. I have 25 years experience as a therapist in private practice. I work primarily with couples. Common problems: Disagreements and arguments, self-esteem to one looks like selfishness to the other, trouble with family/children/others, affairs, ambivalence, loss of meaning, other losses. I was with The Couples Institute 14 years. Then, for 9 years, I taught highly rated graduate courses in Couples and Family Systems Therapy at The Institute of Transpersonal Psychology.

234	128586	Sushma Trivedi	I believe that all clients have the resources within them to resolve the emotional and social challenges they are presented with in life. I work with individuals and couples, as well as children and adolescents on a range of problems.

I grew up in India and have been in the US since 1981. I am intimately familiar with the two cultures. I try to understand how my client's thinking style and patterns of relationships are related to their prior life events and current circumstances. I assist them in identifying the real issues and help them in changing the problematic aspects of their life. The methods I employ depend on their needs and goals. I received M.A. in Counseling Psychology from Santa Clara University and worked in academia and the high-tech industry before becoming a therapist.

235	35526	Jill Kaplan	Unresolved and unconscious issues can affect our well-being and inhibit our enjoyment of our relationships and our life. Taking a journey of unraveling the threads of your life in the context of a relationship with someone who can witness and mirror where you have been and where you are now can bring you into a fuller relationship with your true self. While adults may be adept at talking about their problems, children's difficulties are best understood through the metaphor of play, in the presence of a trained professional. My clinical interests are in analytic psychotherapy and Sandplay. I offer children the opportunity to express themselves through Sandplay, games, art materials, dramatic play with puppets and dolls. Whether with adults or children, my belief is that the presence of an unconditionally accepting witness is essential to healing and growth. I offer depth psychotherapy which is analytically informed, and believe in working in the here and now of the relationship. Additionally, I have many years of training in Sandplay, a non-verbal, expressive modality especially suited to children as well as adults looking for a transpersonal approach.	6502097701	2016-05-05 01:14:33	2016-05-05 01:14:33

239	7050	Brendan Pratt	As a father of two children, I know how important it is to seek the best education for our children. Being a compassionate psychologist with over ten years experience in supporting children who struggle with learning, inattention, anxiety and depression, I understand that learning, socializing and adapting to new environments can be difficult. Psychological testing can highlight a child's strengths, clarify areas of need and provide parents and teachers with practical steps they can take. I work with children with all levels of skill and areas of concern. Together with parents and teachers, we work to ensure that your child has the appropriate environment for learning. I completed my doctorate in clinical psychology at the California School of Professional Psychology and a two-year post-doctoral fellowship in pediatric neuropsychology.

As a certified EMDR practitioner, I find this intervention a useful adjunct to therapy, as it helps clients come to terms with issues more quickly.

263	117652	Nancy Andersen	It's time to start feeling better. You've tried distraction, talking to friends. But like a ball pushed underwater, your feelings of anxiety, unhappiness, grief or sadness keep surfacing. Distress disturbs your life, relationships and sleep. Worst of all, these bad feelings, like a shameful secret, isolate you. It doesn't have to be this way. Asking for help to feel better is a sign of strength, not weakness. I am dedicated to helping individuals and couples recognize and overcome the obstacles between them and their dreams. Personal growth, intimacy and self-confidence are natural outcomes of successful therapy. With counseling, each conversation is an opportunity to understand yourself, your partner (if applicable) and your choices better, improve relationships, laugh more and feel optimistic about your future. What would your life be like without distress? Together we can find out, working through the blocks, recognizing patterns and instilling hope. I am the only Los Altos couples counselor trained in Emotionally Focused Therapy, an empirically-validated method to alleviate marital distress. EFT goes beyond repairing rifts, fostering connection, personal growth and intimacy to create a safe haven/secure base for couples.

278	135589	Beate Klein	Your life wants to find shelter, a place to look at what works and what doesn't. Psychotherapy provides a safe place from where you can travel, explore, and listen to the sound between the lines. I invite you to embark on a voyage that gently and steadily benefits yourself and your relationships with those around you.

Finding your way through life's maze as an individual, couple, or as a family can be one of your most wonderful achievements. Throughout my work, I have been involved in working with people from very different cultural backgrounds. Attending closely to where a person comes from has been perceived as helpful in facilitating connections between present and past and the feeling of being understood.	6502414687	2016-05-05 01:17:12	2016-05-05 01:17:12
