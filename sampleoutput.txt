SUMMARY
-------------------------
I have closely worked with and have a deep understanding of psychological needs of medically ill population. If you're someone who takes multiple medications for medical problems and need psychiatric care I could be the right Psychiatrist for you. Patients often feel uncertain about starting a new medication. I'm often asked "will this medication interact with my other medications?". I will work with you and help you decide if you need psychotropic medication(s). I only recommend starting medication when I believe it's likely to benefit you and am knowledgeable about medication interactions and side effects. I received my Psychosomatic Medicine subspecialty training at Stanford. I have experience managing medically ill patients with psychiatric needs. Some of the patients I see have cancer, HIV, organ failure, post-organ transplant, Multiple Sclerosis, Epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Diabetes, Dementia etc. I also see General Adult psychiatry patients. At Savant Care we believe in integrated interventions to improve your mental health. We always consider modalities other than medications to help improve your quality of life such as psychotherapy, group therapy, yoga, bio-feedback, CBT etc.
